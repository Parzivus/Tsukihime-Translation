<Page1>
"―――I see. Yeah, you're a good person, aren't you?"
"...?"
<Page2>
I look up, surprised.
The woman is smiling.
Even though she said she is a vampire, she has a very honest face.
<Page3>
"I've decided.
As I thought, I'll make you help me out after all."
<Page4>
"―――Wha?"
She gives me a different, more meaningful smile than before.
Help... help her...?
<Page5>
"Hey. What do you mean 'help'?"
"I'm saying in exchange for my forgiveness,
I was wondering if you could help me get rid of the vampire that has taken root in this city."
"――――――"
...No, I'm getting more confused.
<Page6>
"Wait, you're going to forgive me? Are you really going to forgive me that easily?
In the first place, what do you mean to get rid of the vampire? Aren't you a vampire yourself?"
<Page7>
"Ah, no, no. I am a vampire, but the vampire that has taken root in this city is something else.
You live in this city, right?
Then you must know about the recent murders."
<Page8>
"Uhh... well, yeah."
The familiar words cool down my confused mind. It's strange, but the crazy story of the serial murders is many times more real than the current situation.
<Page9>
"...I know about them. The serial killings right? The case of the multiple victims who were killed and drained of their blood―――"
<Page10>
After hearing her say that much, I understand what she is getting at.
So that means...
<Page11>
"Right. When I said vampire, I was referring to that case.
You keep telling me to kill you, but currently, the only person I want to kill is them.
Wouldn't you say that this serial killer is your enemy too?"
<Page12>
"――――――"
My thoughts are racing as I try to catch up with the updated situation.
I understand the context. I can understand what the woman is saying. But fundamentally, my common sense has been left behind.
<Page13>
"Really, humans are so inefficient, I truly don't understand them.
You people call this the work of a 'vampire', yet no one is doing anything about it. It's like a squirrel that won't run away when the forest is on fire."
<Page14>
"Well, I mean, there's no such thing as vampires, right?"
"Mmph."
The woman frowns sullenly.
...That's right.
I remember that this person in front of me is some unknown being who calls herself a vampire.
<Page15>
"...But then, what about it?
You're going to get rid of the vampire that's been killing people in this city?"
And now you're asking me to help you do it?
<Page16>
"Yeah. You see, my plans have fallen apart in a big way.
Yesterday, I was attacked and killed by a random murderer for whatever reason. Yeah, that was a real bummer. It was a perfect surprise attack, and I was cut into seventeen pieces before I could even try to fight back."
<Page17>
"How can one pursue a person they've only just met, kill her, and walk away satisfied? It's so cruel that it makes me sick. He really is nothing but a cold-blooded murderer."
<Page18>
"Ugh――――"
...Damn it. No matter how I look at it, she's talking about me.
I'd like to deny it, but there is nothing that I could say.
<Page19>
"As for me, I really was planning on killing you before I got restored to my original state.
That was the first time I had ever been humiliated like that, and I had to use more than 80% of my energy to reconstruct my body."
<Page20>
"But more than anything else, it reeeeeeeally hurt like hell. It hurt so much that I almost lost my mind, but then it hurt so much again that I came back to my senses.
Do you have any idea how it feels to experience that constantly for an entire night?"
<Page21>
"........."
I'm sorry. As a human being, this is beyond anything I can imagine.
<Page22>
"And then, I began to hate you so much that I searched for you.
I got so mad that I even neglected my original goal, which was to find that vampire."
<Page23>
"It was only a couple of hours ago that I found out from the municipal records that your clothes belonged to that school.
I was going to wait until nightfall to catch you, but I was too impatient. In the end, I decided to wait over there."
<Page24>
"........."
I see... so that's why she was waiting for me in front of the school.
I'm sure that after experiencing that much pain, she must have been dying to kill me.
But...
<Page25>
"...I don't understand. If you hated me so much, why are you willing to forgive me now?"
<Page26>
"―――Good point.
To put it simply, I guess I cooled off over time... or something.
I've already used up most of my power, and instead of just mindlessly killing you, I figured it would be more efficient to let you become my meat shield."
<Page27>
"...Hey. Didn't you just say something really awful?"
"Eh? Did I really say something like that?"
"You just said something about using people as shields."
Not to mention that scary image.
<Page28>
"What, isn't that obvious?
Sure, you could say that I've forgiven you, but that was only because I had to deal with my own personal feelings.
The act of murder that you committed must be atoned for by your actions, not by your feelings, right?"
"I mean, that's true, but..."
<Page29>
I was expecting to be killed in revenge, but becoming someone's shield is something else entirely.
...Well, I can't really put into words why they're different, but I still have a bad feeling about it either way.
<Page30>
"I don't know if you're being honest or just being mean.
In case you forgot, you were the one who killed me, remember?
I know it may be hard to imagine, but it takes a lot of energy to come back to life after dying."
<Page31>
"It wouldn't have mattered if you'd merely killed me.
But the way you cut me was nothing like I've ever seen before, and because I couldn't reconnect my body, I had no choice but to rebuild from scratch.
As a result, I had to use practically all of my strength just to come back to life!"
<Page32>
The woman is so angry that she is positively fuming.
Her anger from last night, forgotten until now, seems to have returned during her ramble.
<Page33>
"In any case, I've become weak as of now.
I'm sure I'll recover after a couple of nights, but if I'm attacked before then, there's nothing I can do.# That's why I'm going to need you to be my shield in the meantime."
"No, you can't just go ahead and decide to make me your shield!"
<Page34>
"It's your fault that I'm in this situation, so you should at least do that, right?
Or are you saying that you don't regret anything after all?"
<Page35>
The woman stares straight into my eyes.
".........Ugh."
<Page36>
That's not fair.
Don't look at me like that before I've had the chance to repent or say that I deserve it.
If you're going to call yourself a monster like a vampire, at least stop condemning me with those pure eyes.
<Page37>
"......Are you serious?"
I try to suppress my wavering heart.
I feel a sense of remorse and even atonement.
But my heart is frantically telling me that to cooperate with this person would be a mistake as a human being.//ruby dots <人|・><間|・><と|・><し|・><て|・><間|・><違|・><っ|・><て|・><い|・><る|・>
