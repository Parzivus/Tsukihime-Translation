―――I can't shake off my doubts.
Sensei once told me.
...I'm not asking you to be a saint.
You can become the person you think is right, she said.
<Page2>
I know I'm not thinking straight at the moment, but I can't betray her trust.
<Page3>
Even if Arcueid isn't human, she still believed in me.
She forgave my unforgivable sin with a smile on her face.
If that's the case―――then I should be ashamed of myself as a human being if I don't return that smile as I offer up my own life.
<Page4>
"...I'm an idiot.
I'm really an idiot...!"
<Page5>
With a smack, I slap myself on both cheeks and contemplate my next move.
I get up from the bench.
I'm not going back to school or the mansion.
Without looking back, I run to the hotel once more.
<Page6>
I return to the hotel, just barely making it back before the sun sets.
<Page7>
"......"
I sneak back inside, silencing my footsteps.
If Arcueid is still asleep, there should be no problems for... now... however...
<Page8>
"―――"
"......Mmgh"
As you can see, she is already awake and fuming with anger.
<Page9>
"Shi～～～～ki～～～～......!"
"Uh, uhhh...!"
<Page10>
This is bad. This is really bad.
It would be clear to any onlooker that mademoiselle is furious.
<Page11>
The Arcueid before me now is the one that made such a fearsome scene in the alleyway earlier.
I may have surreptitiously run away... but I came back, didn't I! ...I shudder to think what sort of iron-fisted punishment I'm in for now. If she's not careful, the whole hotel will be split in half.
<Page12>
"N-No, the thing is, you see!?"
It's already too late to try and explain myself, but if I end up getting killed without even attempting it that would be even more shameful than having run away in the first place, so I'll do my best to make excuses.
...However.
<Page13>
"Oh, where have you been?
You should let me know before you go outside!"
<Page14>
"...Huh?..."
This... is a little different to what I had imagined.
<Page15>
"When I woke up at sunset, you were gone. You weren't in the bathroom, so I thought you might have gone down to the lobby to eat, but when I went to look I couldn't find you anywhere.
Just where have you been all this time?"
<Page16>
"........."
It's clear that Arcueid is angry.
But it doesn't seem like she thinks I betrayed her.
<Page17>
"...Well, I just stepped out of the hotel for a second, you know..."
"Are you serious...? Now that the familiars have found you, you're not safe anymore. If you recklessly go outside and get attacked by that black panther again, how exactly do you plan on dealing with it?"
<Page18>
...I'm stunned.
The reason Arcueid is angry isn't because I wasn't there.
The thought that I might betray her and run away didn't even cross her mind.
<Page19>
She's just angry because she's worried that I might be in danger if I selfishly wander around on my own.
<Page20>
"――――――"
...I'm ashamed. I was so close to trampling on her good intentions.
<Page21>
"Hey, Shiki, are you listening to me?"
"...Yeah, I'm listening. You're right, it was my fault.
I'm sorry I left without permission."
I bow my head sincerely.
<Page22>
"Eh...?# H-Hey, you don't have to apologize so seriously..."
<Page23>
"A-Anyway, you are too vulnerable. The enemy is a vampire; you've got to be more careful."
<Page24>
"Or what, do you have a death wish or something? Are you trying to get yourself killed or to piss me off?
If that's the case, I can jump from my ground state to an excited state at the drop of a hat. Would you like me to knock you into a spatial extreme that's beyond the limit of human comprehension?"
<Page25>
"........."
She says something so terrifying in such a benevolent manner.
<Page26>
"Not a chance. Also, that's just called Hell. Don't underestimate human linguistic capabilities, you idiot."
<Page27>
"You were just as vulnerable yourself, you know. ...I mean, I've already killed you once, remember? It's crazy to sleep with me as your lookout.
You can't be sure that I won't do it again, can you?"
