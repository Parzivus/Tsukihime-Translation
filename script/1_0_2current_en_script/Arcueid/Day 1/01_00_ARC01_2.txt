I walk to school a little slower than usual.//普段よりいくぶん遅めの足取りで登校する。
By the time I see the main gate, it's almost seven o'clock.
Students on their way to club activities are hurrying past the main gate.
They must be trying to use up the limited time they have until eight o'clock, the start of homeroom.
<Page2>
Tokyo Metropolitan Souya High School.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the old school's founding.
It is a totally unremarkable high school with a moderate rate of advancement and extracurricular activities as well as reasonably lax school rules.//進学率はそこそこ、部活動はほどほど、校則はそれなりに自由な、ごく平均的な高等学校。ごく extremely, very minor change
<Page3>
The only complaint from the male students is a very common one: 'Please improve the outdated uniform design'. Our request has been summarily ignored.//男子生徒の唯一の不満は『古くさい制服のデザインを改善してほしい』という、まことにありきたりのもので、こちらは一向に聞き届けられない。The last part was untranslated
On the other hand, the female students' uniform was changed three years ago.
The school thought that the number of applicants would decrease if they had to wear the old-fashioned sailor uniforms, so they did the best they could to compromise.
<Page4>
"Hmm...?"
I feel a faint sense of discomfort in the familiar scenery.
This morning is somewhat hectic.
<Page5>
Teachers are running to the staff room with pale faces.
There is a black car parked in the parking lot that I have never seen before.
The sky is bleak.
For some reason, I imagine a funeral with no attendees or a black and white striped curtain that goes on and on.
<Page6>
...I sigh at my dark thoughts.
I decide to shake off my unpleasant premonition and head to the classroom.
<Page7>
I enter the empty classroom.
I sit down on my chair and kill time until the morning homeroom.
As I studiously dedicate myself to my prep work, the classroom begins to fill with people.
<Page8>
"Good morning. Today's morning practice is over."
"Huh, I'm not the first one here? You're pretty fast, Tohno."
"Oh, that's right, volunteers!"
"But is it actually today? Oh no, I might have skipped it!"
<Page9>
In class 2-C, the students get along better than in other classrooms.
They greet each other the moment they meet and then sit in their own seats.
<Page10>
The students who finished their club activities are talking with the rest.
Everything ranging from last night's news report on the internet, which has been consumed to the point where there is no room for debate, to the new information about the school that happened just ten minutes ago is being discussed.
<Page11>
It might just be simple idle talk to kill time, but it's a necessary part of our routine.
It's a light warm-up before the day begins.
In this age of information overload, it would be exhausting for both you and the other person if we were to engage in serious dialogue all the time.
<Page12>
The atmosphere in the classroom suddenly changes.
The harmonious chatter is replaced by furtive whispering.//和気藹々としていた雑談が、身を潜めるような小声に変わっている。
<Page13>
"Hey, don't block the road, assholes.
It's early in the morning and you're already swarming in and blocking the way."
Vicious words reverberate in the classroom as if to ignore the fact that classmates are present.
I don't need to see it to confirm it. The atmosphere in the classroom has changed because of the arrival of this―――
<Page14>
"Sup! Good mornin' four-eyes!
Man you look irritated this morning. You seriously look like shit!"
"........."
It's the fault of this delinquent that we've strayed from the idyllic colors of our school.
<Page15>
"Hey, where's my greeting?
Someone goes out of their way to see you this morning, and you don't even say hello? Rather, don't you have any words to thank me for gracing you with my presence?"
<Page16>
"No, I don't. It's just that I'm tired of seeing your overbearing face in the morning.
Besides, I have no reason to thank you. I didn't come to school for you."
<Page17>
"What? Don't be ridiculous! I came to school just for you! Isn't that unfair?!"
"........."
I'm speechless.
Sometimes I wonder why I'm his best friend.
<Page18>
Orange dyed hair and pierced ears.
He wears rebellious attire that gives off a bad image, as though he was ready to fight with anyone at any time.
In this day and age when the culture of delinquent students has died out, he is a free-spirited purveyor of violence.//不良学生という文化がすたれた現代において、暴力性を売りにした自由気ままなアウトロー。 I don't think a literal translation of 売る works well here
That's him, Inui Arihiko.
<Page19>
"...Well, okay. It's a good thing to come to class in the morning.
Good morning, Arihiko. Are you finally starting to care about your attendance?"
<Page20>
"Nah, I'm not worried about that. There's still plenty of room for me to skip.# I've got my sister at home today, so I just can't slack off.
Besides, I've been staying up all night playing Mahjong and I'm at the end of my rope."//つーか朝まで徹マンしてたんで、いいかげん体力の限界だ」 徹マンする is staying up all night playing Mahjong. I think Arihiko references Mahjong a few other times too, including one very tricky line much later
"I see. My bad, let me redo my greeting.
Good night, Assihiko. Hurry up to your desk and get some sleep."
<Page21>
"Come on, what a cold reaction.
That's your attitude toward your rival from middle school? Couldn't you be more passionate about it!?"
<Page22>
"...Why do you and I have to be rivals?
If you want to live an unprincipled life, find some like-minded people on the street. Don't bother me too much."
No, I've lent him almost 10,000 yen since middle school and he hasn't given it back, so I can call him a foreign enemy at this point.
<Page23>
"I don't get why you only act this coldly toward me.
You're like a saint to everyone else, isn't it unfair?"
"What, didn't you already know?
There's nothing fair about the world."
<Page24>
"That's true...
But aren't you especially cold to me?"
<Page25>
Arihiko sighs exaggeratedly.
It's not like I'm being cold to him on purpose, it's just a natural consequence of how frank we are with each other.
Although our interests and tastes are different, we are on the same wavelength somehow, I guess.
<Page26>
"...Well, there's nothing really wrong about running away from home.
But to think that a night owl like you would attend class so early in the morning, how did it come to that?
It's a bit, well, quite unusual."
<Page27>
"Yeah, I guess so.
Waking up isn't enough reason on its own to come to school. Maaan, I wanna go home. Studying is something you really need to want to do, huh."
<Page28>
He's certainly right, but when this man says it, I feel that it's admirable just to come to school even if you don't have the will.
<Page29>
"You can discuss that with the mirror the next time you're free.
What I want to ask you is why you don't just go to the city. Wouldn't karaoke or a manga cafe be a better way to kill time?"
"That's the thing. It's getting real dangerous out there these days.
I'm not breaking into a fight scene for free, and I'd only show up if I had the energy to begin with."
<Page30>
"Dangerous...?"
"Oh? Surely you'd know about it. About that.
I'm talking about the random murder cases that have been causing a stir recently. There's even cops patrolling around the area in front of the station at night now."//派手に出回派手に出回ってる通り魔事件の話だよ。駅前のセンター街、夜になると警官も巡回しているしな
"Oh yeah, I think I heard something like that."
<Page31>
I started to remember after hearing it from Arihiko.
The house I was staying at until yesterday is a few stations away from here, so the incidents around Souya station are somewhat foreign to me.
It should've been all over the news.
If I recall correctly―――
<Page32>
"What is it again? I know it sounds like a really vulgar sales pitch."
"The Midnight Street Killer Incidents, right?"
<Page33>
"A series of bizarre murders. The victims were usually young women, and a dead body, which was found two days ago, was the eighth. All of them have cross-shaped wounds on their throats, too."
What the hell?
I can't even imagine a situation like that.
<Page34>
"That's wrong, Inui-kun. All the people killed lost a significant amount of blood."
<Page35>
I'm not sure if we were talking too loudly, but Yumizuka, who is nearby, pops up and corrects him.
<Page36>
"Ah, right, right. It looked like a modern-day vampire, didn't it?
Thanks, Yumizuka, mornin'!"
<Page37>
"Good morning to you too, Inui-kun.
Oh, also, the trauma varies from person to person with some having no wounds at all whereas others have really severe injuries... I think."
<Page38>
"You know a lot about it, don't you, Yumizuka-san?"
"N-No, I don't!
It's a major case happening in our city after all, and if you watch the news, you're bound to remember it!"
<Page39>
"Well, that's how it is, Tohno.
Even for me, there's no way I'd be hangin' out at night while there's a serial killer around. I've been quietly spending my late nights at home these days."
<Page40>
"Oh, so that's your reason?
I'm surprised you're so reasonable. It's not like you to stay at home, scared of a murderer."
<Page41>
"It's not that strange, most people are scared of murderers.
I wouldn't even have the will to fight, not to mention the killer's thirst for blood or the possibility of a surprise attack. Hell no to that. I ain't throwin' away my life just yet."
"...Oh, I see. You're right, if you're targeted, you'll have to fight to the bitter end."
<Page42>
"Come on, man. Don't I even get the choice to run away?
Why would I have to fight to the death?"
"What? Escape isn't an option in that scenario, right?"
<Page43>
"Right, I was an idiot for going to you.
Actually, I don't care about the murderer either. They're like natural disasters, right? It's just bad luck to run into them.
My reason for not going out into the city is more practical. Lately, there've been a bunch of new idiots in front of the north gate. To be honest, I don't even wanna see their faces."
<Page44>
In front of the north gate... that's downtown opposite the office district. At night it's bustling with lots of people and traffic.
Arihiko also lives near the north gate, so if he's avoiding these 'new idiots', they must be a pretty dangerous group indeed.
<Page45>
"Haven't you heard of them?
It's like a test of courage. You go into an underground passage through a secret entrance, and if you make it to the end, you win a lot of money, or so they say."
<Page46>
"I've heard of that too, but... isn't it just a ghost story?"
<Page47>
"Well, it's been an urban legend for a long time.
Those idiots have gone in and tried to turn it into some kind of scam. I don't know where they came from, but there's a terrible atmosphere by the north gate now. The slightest thing can kick off a fistfight."
<Page48>
"Basically, I don't wanna get hurt, right? If they keep being so brazen, the police will step in soon. I'll just play it safe and stay indoors for a while until they're caught."//「オレ、基本的に痛いのイヤだし？ あんだけ派手にやってれば<警|ポ><察|リ>も動くだろうし、連中が捕まるまで、しばらく自重して家にこもってんのよ」 Adding 自重 minor change
<Page49>
The urban legend of the north gate... Unfortunately, I am not a local, so it's unfamiliar to me.
After today, it won't be a strange thing to me anymore... I think.
<Page50>
"Hey, what's with the lack of response?
It must be that, right? Did you collapse from anemia this morning?"
<Page51>
"No, I'm fine.
It's nice of you to worry about me, but my body wouldn't be able to take it if I'm that anemic all the time."
"Yeah, I guess you're right. If you say you're okay, then you must be okay."
<Page52>
"Come on, class is about to start. Get back to your seat and go to sleep."
"Right. ...Oh, yeah. For today's lunch, I'll be in the cafeteria. I've invited a special guest to surprise you, so look forward to it."
<Page53>
Laughing as if he were planning something, Arihiko goes back to his seat. //Marked to recheck
<Page54>
"See you later, Tohno-kun."
"Ah, yes. I'm sorry for making you accompany me, Yumizuka-san."
With quick, light steps, Yumizuka returns to her seat.
<Page55>
Five minutes after the bell announcing the start of homeroom, our teacher, Toyama-sensei, still has not arrived.
Just as homeroom was about to end, the teacher next door comes in and announces that Toyama-sensei is absent.
<Page56>
"Woohoo! Today's math class is self-study!"
Someone in the class shouted in victory.
<Page57>
Toyama-sensei is the math teacher.
If she is absent, today's class will be self-study. The rest of the time can be used freely as long as we complete the assigned printouts.
Some students use it to study, some to play.//彼女が欠勤なら今日の授業は自習になる。課題のプリントをこなしさえすれば、残りの時間は自由に使える。 Toyama-sensei is a woman
<Page58>
I start to work on my math problems.
When I was a child, I was told that it would be difficult for me to enter a prestigious school with my body, so I stopped going to cram school in middle school, but studying itself was still interesting. //School repeated 3 times?
Whether you go on to higher education or enter the workforce, having knowledge is not a waste.
After solving a few application problems, I look up and see the students in the hallway.
<Page59>
Since my seat is far away, I can only hear fragments of their voices.
<Page60>
"I knew it..." # "I can't believe it..."
"During the morning practice, the teachers turned pale as they entered the staff room..."
"It's still just a rumor." # "But for it to happen so easily."
"That's terrible, how did that happen?"
I furrow my brow, thinking that the worse my premonition is, the more likely it is to come true.
<Page61>
"Yesterday's incident." # "There were two guys in the principal's office who looked like detectives."
I prepare myself for what is to come next.
It's something I'm used to, but I breathe in and wait for the words so that I don't dismiss it as something natural.
<Page62>
"You know... I heard Toyama died last night."//A woman
I close my eyelids gently as if blocking out my headache.
<Page63>
The rumors about Toyama-sensei did not spread very far, and the morning class ends without incident.
<Page64>
It is lunchtime, and the classroom is in chaos.
Some are in the cafeteria, some are in the courtyard, and some are still in their classrooms spreading out their lunches.
Now, where should I have lunch?
C:> I'll meet up with Arihiko at the cafeteria.
C:> I'll stay in the classroom and see what happens.
C:> I'll figure it out in the hallway.
