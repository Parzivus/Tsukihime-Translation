After having breakfast in the dining room, I go out to the lobby.
Behind me is Hisui, carrying my bag.//　後ろには鞄を持った翡翠が付き添ってくれている。 "添ってくれている。" intentionally left out.
I suggested that I could carry my own bag, but she insisted on carrying it to the door at least.
<Page2>
...I seem to have a weak spot not only for Akiha, but Hisui as well.
Oh, well, a soft spot would probably be more accurate.//　あ、いや、正しくは、翡翠には甘い、かもしれない。liberally translated
<Page3>
In Akiha's case, she is simply correct so I lose in terms of reasoning. It is also true that Tohno Akiha's position is above Tohno Shiki's.
<Page4>
But Hisui is the complete opposite.//　けれど翡翠は真逆だ。
I'm in a position of power over Hisui, but I don't think I can wield that power to my advantage.//　俺は翡翠に強くでられる立場だが、その強権を振り回そうとは思えない。
I don't know why, but when Hisui stares at me, I feel like listening to anything she says...
<Page5>
"Shiki-san, Shiki-san! Please wait a minute!#"
Kohaku-san hurries down from the second floor with a clatter of footsteps.
"............"
Hisui steps aside as soon as Kohaku-san arrives.
<Page6>
"Hey, weren't you with Akiha?"
"Akiha-sama is being taken to school by car.
I stayed behind because I needed to deliver something to you."
<Page7>
"A delivery? For me?"//「お届け物って、俺に？」
"Yes. Yesterday, I received a package from the Arima family."
Kohaku-san gives me a wide grin.//　ニッコリと琥珀さんは笑みをうかべる。 more accurately "shows me a wide grin" but I think "gives" is a little more natural
<Page8>
"...? But I brought all my stuff with me.
Everything I used over there originally belonged to the Arima family. The only things that belong to me are the clothes on my back..."//　もともとむこうで使ってたのは有間の家のものだったから、自分の物なんて着てる服ぐらいで……」
<Page9>
"Really? This package was delivered for you, though."//「そうなんですか？　こちらが届けられたお荷物ですけど」
Kohaku-san hands me a thin wooden box, about twenty centimeters long.
It doesn't weigh much.
<Page10>
"―――Kohaku-san. I've never seen this before."
"I was told it was in your father's belongings. I also heard he left it to you in his will."
<Page11>
"...My father left this to me?"
...It's not really sinking in.//　……それこそ実感が湧かない。
Why would Tohno Makihisa, the man who kicked me out of this mansion seven years ago, leave me a parting gift?
<Page12>
"Oh well. Kohaku-san, can you take this to my room?"//「まあいいや。琥珀さん、これ部屋に置いておいて」sentence turned into a question for softening purposes.
"―――――"
Kohaku-san is staring intently at the wooden box.//　琥珀さんはじーっ、と興味深そうに木箱を見つめている。"興味深そう" deliberately left out to avoid redundency
She looks almost like a child who wants a toy.//　なんだか玩具をほしがる子供みたいな仕草だ。
<Page13>
*stare*
No, she is a child.
<Page14>
"...Okay, I get it. You want to know what's inside, don't you?"//「……わかりました。中身が気になるんですね、琥珀さんは」
"No, not at all.
I'm just curious as to what kind of gift it is."
...No, you're curious enough, Maid-san.
<Page15>
"Then, let's open it. Ready? Open."
The wooden box opens with a soft, dry sound.
Inside there is a thin iron rod, about 15 centimeters long.
<Page16>
"It's... an iron rod."
A plain iron rod that looks like it's seen regular use.//　とくに飾り気のない、使い込まれた跡のある鉄の棒。
<Page17>
...Leaving me an antique heirloom like this, my father must have really hated me.//　……こんな骨董品が形見とは、親父はよっぽど俺が気に食わなかったとみえる。
Besides, the iron bars my father used were a bit thicker and more rugged―――
<Page18>
"That's wrong, Shiki-san.
This is a fruit knife, isn't it?"
Kohaku-san takes the iron rod out of the box.
<Page19>
"You know those knives with blades that pop out?//「ほら、飛び出しナイフってあるじゃないですか。
It's like that. Okay, here we go."
<Page20>
With a snap, a blade that is about ten centimeters long springs out.
...Huh, it really is a knife.//　……なるほど、たしかにこれはナイフだ。
<Page21>
"The structure of this blade is modern, but the outside looks very old. Look, the year and era it was made in are engraved on the grip."
<Page22>
Kohaku-san retracts the blade and hands me the knife.
...There is indeed a number engraved on the bottom of the grip.
The character for 'seven', and next to it, the character for 'night'.
<Page23>
"Nee-san, there is no era by that name.
It just says 'Nanatsu-yoru'."//　七つ夜、と書かれているだけよ」
"Eh...!"
When I turn around I see Hisui, who was silent until now, peering at the knife
<Page24>
"Y-You surprised me... don't scare me like that, Hisui.
You don't have to look over my shoulder like that. If you wanna see, here."
<Page25>
"Ah―――――――"
<Page26>
"P-Please excuse me.
Um―――that dagger is so beautiful, I couldn't resist."
"I dunno if I'd use the word 'beautiful'
At a glance, the blade looks dull and the styling is rather old-fashioned."
<Page27>
"That is not true at all. I think it is an antique with a lot of history."
"...Really? It looks like a piece of junk to me..."
<Page28>
Since Hisui is so adamant about it, I'm starting to feel the same way.
...Yeah.
Still, maybe this isn't such a bad memento after all.
<Page29>
"'Nanatsu-yoru'... is it? Maybe that's the name of this fruit knife?"//「七つ夜……ですか。その果物ナイフの名前でしょうかね？」 transliterated version used above
I don't think many people name their knives... whatever it is, it's definitely an antique.//　ナイフに名前を付ける人はそうはいないと思うけど……なんにせよ年代物なのは確かだろう。
<Page30>
I put the blade away in my bag. It's a violation of the Weapons Act, but I hope they'll overlook it for at least one day.
I'll show it to Arihiko later and brag about it... well, if he's at school that is.
<Page31>
"Shiki-sama. Are you ready to go...?"
"Crap. I'd better get going or I'm gonna be late.//「まずい、そろそろ行かないと間に合わないか。
Okay, Kohaku-san, thanks for the delivery."
'No problem.' says Kohaku-san, waving us off.
<Page32>
Upon reaching the mansion gate, I notice that there is a lot of commotion.
<Page33>
"...What is it? What's all the noise about?"//「……なんだろ。なんかあっちのほう、騒がしくないか？」
"You see, they found some blood on the road this morning."
"Blood...? You mean... like, bloodstains?"//「血痕……？　血の跡……ってことか？」
<Page34>
"Yes, there was also blood on the wall of our property.
It seems that while you were asleep, the police came to inquire about what happened last night."
<Page35>
"Does that mean that somebody died...?"//「それって、人が死んでたとか……？」
"No, they only found traces of blood."
"――――――"
<Page36>
The public road east of the mansion, ―――that's where I went to check last night.
Bloodstains... spattered crimson clinging to the walls.//　血痕……飛び散り、こびりつくような赤い色。"color" dropped to avoid redundency and for consistency with 00_02
At that time, there was no such conspicuous color anywhere.
There was only black. Only the biting cold. Not even the slightest hint of the warmth of blood existed.
<Page37>
"Shiki-sama?"
"......No, it's nothing.
I'll see you later. Thanks for seeing me off."
<Page38>
"Have a good day. Please take care on your way."
<Page39>
Hisui bows deeply.
I'm just going to school so I don't need to be careful, but I think she's concerned about my health in her own way.
<Page40>
"Thank you. I'll try to be careful. Take care of yourself, Hisui."
I raise my hand lightly, thank Hisui, and leave through the mansion gate.
