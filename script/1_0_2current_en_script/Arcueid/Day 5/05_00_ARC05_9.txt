"――――"
The cold air cuts my skin.
My body temperature drops.
The intense cold makes it difficult just to survive.//ruby dots <た|・><だ|・><生|・><き|・><る|・>
My brain creaks as if it's being squeezed by my skull.
<Page2>
Predicting the outcome of the next two minutes, I want to tear out my heart, which is already ready to burst.//Not sure where the 'I want to' is coming from here? 俺は２分後の結末を予測し、破裂しそうな心臓をかき毟る。
<Page3>
Corpses swarm toward Arcueid.
A procession reminiscent of midsummer in the midst of the extreme cold.
They're like ants gathering sugar under the blazing sun.
Arcueid will be killed.
Those corpses will tear her limb from limb, just as I did, and offer up her dismembered body.//Weirdness here with the split personality 俺が／おまえが: あの死体どもに手足をもぎとられ、俺が／おまえがしたように、解体されて献上される。
<Page4>
All while I watch from a safe distance.
Just like that―――#Just like that?
<Page5>
"―――I can't."
That thing is a disaster that just happens to be in human form.
I shouldn't have pursued him.
It was beyond arrogant of me to think that I could defeat him.
<Page6>
Stopping him from killing anyone else?
Solving the problem without any more casualties?
How foolish. I should have looked the other way. I shouldn't have confronted that monster. As with a typhoon, there's no option but to let it pass. If I had done that, then the city may have only ended up being burned to the ground.// あの怪物は見逃すしかなかった。台風のように、通り過ぎるのを待つしかなかった。
<Page7>
"―――But, I can't."//Do not alter this page without playtesting
She, who could do nothing. Me, who chose to do nothing.//Crushed to fit on a single line/free up space
She, who wasn't even armed. Me, who carried a weapon.//Crushed to fit on a single line/free up space
Common sense and irrationality writhe within my pressurized brain.
My consciousness turns to my rear, telling me to run. There's nothing I can do to stop it.
It's no use after all. What could I possibly do against an opponent like that? That woman. From here on I'm totally out of my depth. That woman. I should just run away. Just look away. Any decent human would. That woman, will be killed.//Ruby <ま|・><っ|・><と|・><う|・><な|・><人|・><間|・>
<Page8>
I look up at the sky. Frozen buildings surround my vision.
The people that had passed away in an instant. They probably didn't even have time to scream.
The scene at the hotel last night. I think back to the pleas of those people who were killed without reason.
The fallen figure. The corpses drool sloppily as they draw near the <woman|f l e s h   >. The expanding river of ice. Throughout, the vampire continues to observe the death of the city with indifference―――//First woman dropped 倒れた女の姿。だらしなく<涎|よだれ>をたらして<女|にく>にすり寄る死体。
<Page9>
"――――――There's no doubt about it."
My skull cracks. Under these freezing conditions, my heart pumps blood ferociously.
That is, in other words...
<Page10>
"――――――I cannot allow this."
All of the fear running down my spine transforms into anger.
I'm defective. A laughingstock. Far too immature as a human.# After all,# not a single atom in my body can tolerate just observing―――!
<Page11>
I take off my glasses.
I cover my mouth with my left hand to desperately hold back my shivering and prevent any more warmth from seeping out.//口からこみ上げる震えに、はき出される体温に、左手で必死にフタをする。
<Page12>
One minute, no, three minutes.
I firmly etch this time constraint into my mind.
It's not a matter of mental strength. That is the limit of human activity inside that pit.
<Page13>
"Shit―――shit, shit, shit―――!
What the hell am I doing―――!"
<Page14>
I berate myself as I descend the slope.
This is ridiculous. I'm being foolish. I really am an idiot.
<Page15>
Run away because I don't want to die?
That's backwards. If you don't want to die, you need to do the opposite.//Reified 理由 for clarity. 逆だ。その理由ならまったく逆だったのだ。
That thing is something that should not be tolerated.
That thing is something that cannot be allowed to go unchecked.
Running away will undoubtedly lead to death. Not only for myself, but for this entire city.
<Page16>
In that case, then it's obvious what I must do.
If you don't want to die, then kill. Run for the sake of survival.
Kill that thing right here, right now, without waiting even a second.
<Page17>
I've pretty much run out of patience at this point.
That thing killed, robbed, and survived without a second thought.
As a different <organism|p e r s o n   >, I cannot allow him to reside in the same plane of existence.
Whatever it may be, if it's alive then it's my prey.
Right here, I'll put an end to the core of his very existence...!//ここで、ヤツの生命の根幹を止めてやる......！
<Page18>
I run toward Arcueid.
The corpses are trying to sink their teeth into her body.
<Page19>
The question from earlier of whether I could kill them or not comes to mind.
Can I kill something that looks like a person, regardless of whether or not it is really human?
<Page20>
―――It doesn't matter.//Do not alter this page without playtesting
My head simply hurts right now.
The first time I've seen with my bare eyes for so long.//Crushed for page space
The first time I've acted with such objective thought.//Crushed for page space
As I look down on the lines of death in a frenzy,
I memorize the images of the corpses I must kill.//Crushed for space
Don't touch her. You're an eyesore. The dead should not eat the living.
Besides―――
The only creature that is allowed to prey on that woman is me.//ruby dots <そ|・><の|・><女|・><を|・><獲|・><物|・><に|・><す|・><る|・><な|・>
<Page21>
I cut the lines of the three corpses.
Each of them are split into three pieces. Like cutting through butter, the corpses are slit open and perish.//胴体をそれぞれ三分割。死体たちはバターを切るように割かれ、死亡する。
Too easy. Their attention was focused on Arcueid after all. How can you even be that defenseless?
<Page22>
"Wake up! How long are you going to stay asleep for...!"
There's no need to come in contact with Arcueid.
I call out to her as I kill the fourth corpse.
<Page23>
"Mmm... Shi... ki?"
Perhaps regaining consciousness as a result of my call, Arcueid weakly opens her eyes.//俺の呼びかけで意識が戻ったのか、アルクェイドは弱々しく目を開ける。
<Page24>
"W-What are you doing here? No, run away...!"
<Page25>
As Arcueid begins to sit up, her face contorts and she doubles over.//アルクェイドは体を起こしかけ、顔を歪めて体を丸めた。
She's back to being conscious. Her life is still intact. But her wound is not healed.
<Page26>
She can't move from here yet.
The one that should be running is her, not me. But unfortunately, I cannot allow her that luxury.
<Page27>
"Okay, you're fine. That's good. Back me up if you can."
"Back you up― You're telling me that you're going in alone!? Are you insane!?"
"Would I be here if I wasn't?
Listen, this place is like the bottom of the ocean for me. I only have three minutes. That's why in that time―――"
<Page28>
"This time for sure. We'll kill that bastard together and end this."
<Page29>
I leave Arcueid behind and run.
I adjust my grip on the knife and measure the distance between me and Vlov.
It's about 40 meters.
Six seconds until contact. He still hasn't seen me yet.
<Page30>
―――Three seconds left.
No time to wait and see. I'll finish him off with one blow.
My body is already in a state of flux.
<Page31>
It'll take 3 minutes in total for my body and consciousness to shut down due to the low temperature.//意識と肉体が低温によって停止するまで３分間。
I'm already one minute closer to that limit on my movement.//満足に活動できるリミットは１分もない。
That leaves more than enough. I can already see them―――//Sentence bridged across this line + next - それで十分だ。俺には確かに、
the lines of death that will 'kill' this monster.//あの怪物を"殺す"、死の線が視えている。
<Page32>
The man finally reacts.
With the manner of someone brushing off an insect, he turns his gaze as if to intercept me.//虫を払うような動作で、俺を迎撃しようと視線を向ける。
The giant lance that skewered Arcueid is missing.
Of course it is. I'd be in trouble if it wasn't.
<Page33>
I am no different than the corpses in Vlov's eyes.
He treats me as an incompetent 'thing' that only protects Arcueid.//アルクェイドを守るだけの、無能な"モノ"扱いだ。
A worthless existence, just like the frail <humans|c r e a t u r e s   > he's trampled on before.
<Page34>
"――――――Ha."
That's why I have a chance.
The only thing I can do is take him by surprise.
He's already seen me. I can't attack him from behind.
<Page35>
And yet I can still take him by surprise.//ruby dots <俺|・><に|・><は|・><奇|・><襲|・><が|・><で|・><き|・><る|・>
He doesn't know about my eyes.
He doesn't even consider that a mere human might have the means to kill an immortal vampire with a single blow.
<Page36>
Two seconds left.
I only have to do it once――― to take that risk, to cross the border between life and death.//危険を冒すのは、生死の境を越えるのは一度だけ。
I'll dodge his first move. That's the only thing I'll focus on.
If I can just make it through that gamble, then all I have to do is cut that line―――
<Page37>
"―――!"
At the very last second.
Right at the moment we were about to cross swords, the both of us jump back simultaneously.
We never even came within each striking distance of each other.
<Page38>
There are two reasons.
For one, I made a mistake.
I can't get close to his chest. He is the focal point of this swirling icy wind. The closer I get, the more sluggish my body becomes. Even at running speed, the moment I'm within 2 meters of him I'd lose consciousness, unable to take another step.//ヤツの懐には入り込めない。寒波はヤツを中心に吹き荒れている。近づけば近づくほど俺の体は鈍くなる。俺の走る速度では、ヤツの２メートル圏内に入った時点で、あと一歩届かずに意識が落ちる。
The minimum requirement for a surprise attack.
Getting in close for the kill simply isn't possible against Vlov.//近づいて殺すという条件が、ヴローヴ相手では達成できない。Ruby emphasis on 近づいて殺す
<Page39>
But that's okay. As a matter of fact, I had already taken that possibility into consideration.
However, there is another problem.
This one is far more deadly.
<Page40>
'You bastard―――!'
The headache caused by my exposed eyes blends with my own rage.
<Page41>
I don't believe this. Of all the things that could happen, that bastard managed to see through me.
It must have been his intuition.
An awareness of death that surpasses that of a beast.
Despite having no reason to think so, that guy had a sudden intuition that the enemy had a means to kill him, and was afraid. Since he recognized me as a threat, he leapt away without even a second's hesitation.//Ruby emphasis 敵には自分を殺す手段があると直感し
<Page42>
"Why... did I retreat...?"
My retreat was a mere two meters at best.
But his retreat was extraordinary. The guy flew back at least 30 meters.
I guess that must be the 'minimum safe distance' for a vampire. I can't help but laugh at the staggering difference in specs between the two of us.//Reworded - それが吸血鬼たちにとっての"最低限の安全圏"なんだろう。つくづく、生命としてのスペック差に嗤ってしまう。
<Page43>
"...You. What are you...?"
"――――――"
That should be my line.
<Page44>
This is the worst possible situation. I can't bridge the distance anymore.
I've accepted that it's impossible to defeat him,//俺はヤツを倒す事は不可能と認め、
and he's sensed I have a way to kill him.//ヤツは俺に殺害手段があると察した。
From here on out, without a doubt―――
<Page45>
"...Good. Stay back. You can stand there and die."//ruby dots <そ|・><こ|・><で|・><死|・><ん|・><で|・><い|・><ろ|・>
It will be a one-sided slaughter from afar.
