"――――――"
I still want to continue living in a proper, respectable world.
I do feel responsible for killing Arcueid.
But that doesn't mean I think it's fair to be forced into doing something I can't do.
<Page2>
...Arcueid is asleep. I already killed her once, and yet she's put her trust in me and is dozing peacefully.
<Page3>
"......Damn it......!"
Even still, I'm not sure I'm up to it.
I have no reason to be here, no reason to believe that I can be of any help.
If I want to return to 'Tohno Shiki's reality', I'm not going to get another chance.
<Page4>
The corridor is dead silent.
Arcueid rented out all of the rooms on the top floor, so she and I are the only ones up here.
<Page5>
"―――――――"
I still feel a lingering sense of hesitation.
But I shake it off and press the button for the elevator.
<Page6>
Taking the train from the hotel, I return to the city.
...The time is just past noon.
Even if I head to school now, I won't make it there in time for fifth period.
On the other hand, if I go back to the mansion, crawl into bed, and fall asleep, I can forget about everything.
<Page7>
"........."
However, I don't feel like going back to the mansion.
I decide to head to the park to cool my head for a bit.
<Page8>
"―――――Hah"
A sigh escapes my lips.
I sit down on a bench and stare up at the sky in a daze.
<Page9>
A gray sky.
The cloudy, overcast weather perfectly reflects my own mental state.
<Page10>
...I wonder if that woman is still asleep, believing in me.
Even though I killed her, she said she forgave me.
She said she forgave me and so――what the hell am I doing here?
<Page11>
...Last night.
I acknowledged my mistake in Senpai's room and vowed to make amends in my own way.
Is that a vow I could break if my life were in danger, I wonder?
<Page12>
"........."
But, I do want to live after all.
This is a problem that I will struggle with for as long as I live. It's not something that can be resolved by a moment of contrition.
<Page13>
'―――That power belongs to you alone.
But that's the reason why you must never forget.'
<Page14>
"――――"
I remember very important words from a long time ago.
What words did that person... Sensei, leave to me again?
<Page15>
"......"
I can still make it.
The sun has not yet set.
If I return to the hotel before the sun goes down, I can still start over.
<Page16>
"Damn―――――it."
I can't shake off my doubts.
In end, I――――
C:> I think I'll go back to the mansion.
C:> I think I'll go back to the hotel.
