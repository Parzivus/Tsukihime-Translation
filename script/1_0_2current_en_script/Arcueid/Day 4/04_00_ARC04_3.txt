<Page1>
"Have a nice day."
As usual, Hisui sees me off as I leave the main gate.
<Page2>
...But this time.
Hisui stares at me, then takes a small breath as if making up her mind before she continues speaking.
<Page3>
"...Shiki-sama. What did you do yesterday?"
<Page4>
"Nothing in particular. I got sick at school, left early, and was in the middle of coming back..."
―――In the middle?
"―――I was just resting in the park.
...But it was indeed very careless of me, as Akiha said. I'll be careful from now on."
<Page5>
"I did not mean to criticize you.
...It's just that you seemed to be overexerting yourself this morning.# Please take care on the road."
<Page6>
To say even those few words is very forward, coming from Hisui.
She gives me a deep bow and sends me on my way.
<Page7>
As I approach the school, I see more and more people wearing school uniforms.
The time is 7:45.
Everyone is taking it easy, probably because there is plenty of time before homeroom.
<Page8>
Of course, I'm one of them.
This morning I can start my day as usual, without any worries about being late or any other distress.
<Page9>
After I cross this intersection, it's only a little ways to the main gate.
The traffic light turns red, and I stop in front of the crosswalk.
Beyond the crosswalk is the school wall.
The path to the school is protected by a guardrail, and even now students are jostling their way toward the school gate.//Jostling as substitute for compound 我先に + 向かう
<Page10>
At this time of day, the only people on the sidewalk are students from our school.
That is how it should have been.
But in between the restless cars driving by, I sense a white figure.
<Page11>
"―――――Wha"
Over there was a woman.
An unmistakable, white figure.
Golden hair that reminds me of sunlight.
Long, thin eyebrows and red eyes.
I've only seen her once, but there's no way I could mistake her for anyone else.
<Page12>
"―――――"
But it can't be.
Because that woman was torn to pieces by my hands yesterday.
<Page13>
"―――――"
No, that's a lie.
I was told it was just a bad dream by Hisui, Akiha, and even Kohaku-san――――
"―――――"
I shouldn't have accepted their words.
<Page14>
It's just a story that I wanted to believe myself.
So it was not a dream, but reality.
I killed her.
I killed her.
I killed her.
I definitely killed her, without a doubt―――
<Page15>
"―――――Ha―a"
But in that case,
how... how could she...
How could she be there?
How could she be right here, in front of me...?
<Page16>
The traffic light turns green.
The students around me are walking to the other side.
Among them, only I am standing still, in blank amazement.
The woman is sitting on the guardrail, swinging her legs aimlessly.
<Page17>
It is as if she were waiting for someone.
I have no idea how long she has been waiting, but there's nothing grim about her expression.
<Page18>
―――I wonder who she is waiting for.
She is fidgety and restless as if she's waiting for her lover.
<Page19>
...No, hold on. She's waiting?
...Who is she waiting for?
It's obvious. That much is obvious.
I'm sure I would do the same.
In fact, anyone would do the same.
That is if I were to be killed.
I don't have to think about who I would want to see first.
<Page20>
―――I have a bad feeling about this.
A chill runs down my spine like a centipede crawling on my back.
My spine feels like it's going to burst out of my mouth.
<Page21>
The woman in white looks at me.
Our gazes meet. Our aims collide. Everything starts to fall into place.
No. That's just a coincidence. It must be a coincidence.
There are no feelings between us. No connection. No relation.
<Page22>
She's just a stranger who looks like her.
She must be waiting for someone else.
Otherwise, I am living in a nightmare.
Because there is no way that a dead person, a person who got dismembered like that, could possibly be alive.
<Page23>
And yet, the woman is alive and looking at me, smiling.
'So you're finally here.' she says.
She seems deeply satisfied to have found the person who killed her.
<Page24>
The woman raises her hand and makes a friendly smile, then stands up from the guardrail.
She ruffles her hair and comes toward me as I stand there.
<Page25>
"What the hell is―――――that?"
This is a bad dream.
The light turns red.
<Page26>
"Don't come――――don't come, don't come――――"
The woman doesn't seem to care and walks across the road in a straight line as cars come and go.
<Page27>
She's only three meters away.
I don't know if this is a dream or reality.
"I told you――――not to come any closer――――!!"
<Page28>
No matter how loud I shout, the reality in front of me remains the same.
So I just run away from the woman in white.
<Page29>
I run.
I run as fast as I can.
Without any regard for shame or appearances, I keep running as fast as I can along the asphalt road, pushing myself past the crowd.
<Page30>
"Hah, hah, hah, ha―――――!"
My breathing is uneven and my heart is pounding in agony.
But I still run.
My stiffening face has abandoned all of its bodily functions.
<Page31>
My vision is distorted by tears. My throat is burning. My lungs shrivel.
The muscles in my hands are about to tear from shaking so much.
<Page32>
Both of my legs kick the ground haphazardly without regard for my health. Every time I take a step, I feel a numbing pain in my thigh.
But that's okay. I don't care if my legs get torn off.
Because if I don't run, I'll go crazy.
<Page33>
I look behind me.
The woman in white is walking toward me.
She's definitely following me.
The woman I killed is chasing me.
That itself is more than enough reason for my frenzy.
<Page34>
"Hah, hah, hah――――――!"
Ignoring the feeling that my heart is about to explode, I keep on running.
As I look back over my shoulder, I see the woman.
She's chasing me with footsteps as light as a feather.
<Page35>
"Ha, ha, ha, ha―――――!"
My jaw is raised.
My arms are limp.
My legs have lost all feeling long ago.
So why is it, if I'm running as fast as I possibly can, that I can't shake off this person that's only walking?
<Page36>
"Ha, ha, ha, ha――――"
I'm breathing even harder.
I'm not sure how many kilometers I've already run at my top speed.
But when I look back, I still see her walking toward me.
It's a natural, stroll-like manner of walking that I can never get away from.
It's like a ghost burned into a rearview mirror.
<Page37>
"......Haha, haha, haha, hahahaha"
I laugh even though it's not funny. I continue to run while laughing.
<Page38>
"Haha, haha, ahahahahahaha!"
I can't stop laughing.
But I still run. Even though my body is screaming at me that I will die if I run any further, I still run.
<Page39>
The reason for running is obvious.
If she catches up to me, she'll kill me for sure.
I laugh it off, but I know better than anyone that it was just a way for me to cope.
<Page40>
There is no need for any reason or rationale.
This is just the natural rule of karma that everyone knows.
<Page41>
Those who kill will be killed in return.
Since I killed her, she has the right to kill me.
So...
It's just a fact that my life will end the moment I'm cornered.
<Page42>
"Ah..."
I fall to the ground in disarray.
It's not that I stumbled over my feet, but that I couldn't move my arms and legs one more step and collapsed forward.
<Page43>
"...Ah, ha...!"
I crawl over to the edge of the wall and manage to reach it.
<Page44>
I put my hands on the wall and try to stand up, but it was no use.
As soon as I stand up, my knees lose strength and I fall on my backside with a thud.
As it is, my body couldn't move anymore.
<Page45>
"Ha―――ha, ha―――"
I look up and breathe in.
―――It's painful.
I don't have enough oxygen at all.
Because of that, I can't move my head.
I can't even make sense of what I'm doing.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Why. Why. Why is the woman that I killed still alive?
<Page46>
I killed that woman.
I completely and utterly killed her.
So how could she wait for me in front of the school and smile like that?
<Page47>
"...I killed you, I swear."
―――That's right.
I killed her.
I Killed Her.
I KILLED HER.
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why, 
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why, 
Why, Why, Why, Why, Why――――――?!
<Page48>
"Hey, are we done playing tag?"
Step.
A dry sound echoes in the back alley.
<Page49>
She comes in with a light step, shrugs her shoulders in disappointment, turns to me as I lean against the wall, and says:
"Hello. Thank you so much for your hospitality yesterday."
She gives me a big, carefree smile.
<Page50>
"......!"
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I don't know why she's making that face.
The woman, with a smile on her face, nonchalantly walks into this closed alleyway without a care in the world.
<Page51>
"And also here, you forgot this.
You must have been worried, leaving things that can be used as evidence."
<Page52>
A black object is tossed into the air.
It's my bag, which I hadn't even realized that I had lost until this point.
<Page53>
No, wait, what did she just say...?
Evidence? Evidence of what exactly...?
<Page54>
"No―――run, run...!"
I move my feet with that thought, but there's a concrete wall behind me, so I can't escape any further back.
<Page55>
"Hmm? I thought we were done playing tag.
This is a narrow alleyway after all. In addition, there's no one around, so there's no need to worry about anyone getting in the way."
<Page56>
The woman keeps smiling as if she's very happy.
...Narrow alleyway? No one around?
I look around in a panic and get disgusted by my own stupidity.
Running into a place like this is like asking for your own death...!
<Page57>
"It's been a long time.
Eighteen hours later, I finally caught you."
With a clunk, the woman takes another step into the alleyway.
<Page58>
"Y-You're――――"
"What?"
"You are, definitely――――"
<Page59>
"Yeah. I'm the woman you killed yesterday.
I'm glad you remember me."
It was a reply I didn't want to hear, whether it was a lie or the truth.
<Page60>
"―――Tch, don't be ridiculous. A person who's dead can't possibly be alive!"
"Yeah, but that's not so surprising, is it?
It's just that I was killed and then came back to life."
<Page61>
The woman replies simply and makes a clattering sound.
The distance gets shorter and shorter.
<Page62>
"...Came back... to life?"
I mull over the woman's words, stunned.
You've come back to life...?
In other words, you've recovered from near-death? So you went to a doctor and after surgery you were revived... from that state?
<Page63>
"Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way anyone can come back to life after being dismembered like that...!"
<Page64>
"Yeah. That's because I'm not a human."
"―――――Huh?"
The meaning of the woman's words was, well, so simple that there was no other way for them to be interpreted.
<Page65>
I'm not a human being.
That is what the woman in front of me said.
<Page66>
"You're not... human...?"
"Of course not. Do you think there are people who can regenerate themselves after being torn apart limb from limb?"
"――――――"
Of course, there is no way a human can do that.
If there is such a thing, it is a completely different creature that only resembles a human being.
<Page67>
Even if you kill it, it will come back to life.
Even if you stop it from breathing, it doesn't matter.
Even if you tear it apart, it will go back to normal and start moving again.
It's a thing that takes the form of a human, but it can't be called a human.
<Page68>
"――――――Ha―――"
That seems to be the true form of the woman in front of me.
I try to raise my voice to laugh, but my dehydrated throat is so parched that I can't even laugh properly.
<Page69>
"...What are you talking about?"
This is too sick even for a joke,
but it is too much of a coincidence to be laughed at.
<Page70>
Because I know.
If this woman is not human, it might make sense that she is still alive, even though she was killed.
<Page71>
"Ha... ha, ha..."
The core of my head calms down.
I remember the words of a certain person who saved me when I was a child.
For now, I need to focus.
After I get out of this situation, I'll have plenty to think about.
<Page72>
"Earlier, you said that you aren't human.
In that case, what are you?"
<Page73>
"Me?# I guess you could call me a vampire.
To put it simply, I'm a monster that lives off human blood."
<Page74>
...Good.
What's good about it is that the word vampire is easy to understand in its own way.
<Page75>
Even a person like me knows what a vampire is.
Even though it's a myth, the word 'vampire' is very well-known.
The concept was created by the novelist Bram Stoker. An immortal creature in human form, as depicted in the stories from the West.
<Page76>
Secondly, and most importantly, the name alone gives you an idea of what they are.
A blood-sucking demon. Since she calls herself a demon, it's only natural that she is not human.
<Page77>
"I see, so you're a vampire―――"
It was so out of the blue that I almost laughed.
Even though I'm going to be killed right after this, it made me feel better.
I'm not sure why, but I feel like I don't care anymore.
<Page78>
The woman looks down at me with a satisfied look, as if she's happy to see me in such a sorry state, having thrown everything away.
<Page79>
...But, I thought the common belief is that vampires can't walk in the sunlight.
Well, that's really a minor issue now.
<Page80>
"...So.
What does a monster like you want from me?"
<Page81>
I give in to despair and throw out those words.
For some reason, the woman backs away.
It was only for a moment, and she immediately folds her hands in front of her chest and gives me a scowl.
<Page82>
"I'm surprised. Have you forgotten what you did to me yesterday?
You dismembered a complete stranger the moment you saw them. And yet here you are, acting like we're close and saying stuff like that."
<Page83>
The woman seems to be more astonished than angry...
But now I feel the same way.
After all, the woman I killed with my own hands is complaining to me about how I dared to kill her.
<Page84>
"Hey. Are you listening, you homicidal maniac?"
"...Yeah, I'm listening. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've had some pretty bad luck.
I'm sorry, but I need you to shut up for a second."
<Page85>
Or rather, I want to put the blame on something else.
Otherwise, I might even commit suicide.
<Page86>
After all this time, I finally realize how bad my luck really is.
There was a woman I suddenly felt like killing for no reason.
I let my impulses get the better of me and killed her.
<Page87>
After that, my memory was vague, and I turned my back on it, thinking it was a dream, but it turned out to be true, and in addition, the person I killed was not human.
I've always called myself defective and unfit, but compared to this situation, everything else can be called normal...
<Page88>
After that, I went through a lot of trouble and despair.
But then, when I decided to make amends in my own way...
I found out that the person I killed wasn't even human!
<Page89>
"―――――――――Ha, haha"
I can't help but laugh.
...But it's not all that bad.
<Page90>
Because the person I killed has come back to life, that means I didn't kill anyone.
The act of 'killing' remains, but she is alive.
I think that alone is something to be happy about.
<Page91>
...Yeah. In that case, I can do this.
Tohno Shiki can go back to his normal life from before.
<Page92>
But instead, I'm being hunted down by some monster... still, that's a lot better than being a murderer.
Bad luck is bad luck, but this is just a stroke of incredibly bad luck.
If this whole ridiculous story is true, then I'm not the only one who's crazy.
<Page93>
"...Okay, I'm calm now.
You have something to say, don't you? Go ahead and get whatever complaints or grudges you may have off your chest."
<Page94>
"There's a lot I want to say, but... you're a strange one. What kind of attitude is that, especially in front of a vampire?"
"I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard not to lose my mind... if I did, I might even kill myself."
<Page95>
If you're going to kill me, then do it already.
I've been dealing with an abnormal body for seven years.
No matter how horrible an event is, if it happens right in front of my eyes I have no choice but to accept that it's reality.
However, I never would have dreamt that a case such as this would have existed.
<Page96>
"Hmmm..."
The woman stares at me.
Her gaze is sharp, but there's no hostility in it.
<Page97>
...It's strange. I'm sure it's a universal rule that if you get hit, you hit back. I'm sure even this woman would be itching to kill me too...?
<Page98>
"...Why're you staring at me?
I know you're here to get revenge on me. Then―――"
<Page99>
"Yes, it's true that if someone kills you, the rule of thumb is to kill them back.
If that's what you want, I'll do it. But for now, I think I'll pass. There's nothing to be gained after all."
The woman looks at me straight in the face.
<Page100>
"Hey, do you regret what you did?"
"...Eh?"
<Page101>
For a moment, I was taken aback.
The woman said something that sounded out of place.
<Page102>
"I'm asking you if you feel remorse for killing me. Because if you do happen to feel sorry for what you did, I'll forgive you.
Besides, you don't seem like a very good liar for a human."
<Page103>
"Me... feel remorse?"
"Yes. As long as you say you're sorry, that's all that matters to me."
<Page104>
―――Unbelievable.
<Page105>
What's unbelievable is not whether she will forgive the person who killed her, but...
It's the fact that this woman's voice sounded so gentle.
<Page106>
"Hey. I'm asking you a serious question, so you should answer properly.
Come on, answer me. Are you feeling sorry for what you've done or not?
If you don't make that clear, we can't move any further."
<Page107>
―――Am I feeling sorry for what I did?
That kind of question didn't need to be asked――――
<Page108>
".........That's..."
As I was about to say the rest, something makes me pause.
I can't do that.
The moment I say it, I'll never be able to return to my former ignorance.
I should keep averting my eyes, not recognizing anything, and continue to pretend to live a normal life.
<Page109>
"What's that?"
"――――――――――"
<Page110>
My throat clenches.
My body is filled with dread, urging me not to say it.
But...
<Page111>
...But I can't run away.
This is something I must not run away from.
Someone who believed in me taught me that.
<Page112>
That if I wish to live a normal life.
From the sins that I've committed,
from the actions that I took,
I must never turn my eyes away―――
<Page113>
"...Yeah, I regret it.
After all, I've killed someone, no matter how I put it."
<Page114>
I confess like I'm being squeezed.
As soon as I spill those words, there is no stopping it.
I accept that... I have become hopeless.
<Page115>
That's right. I killed her.
Mercilessly, for no reason at all.
I just did it for myself.
<Page116>
"...I can regret and reflect on that.
...That is, if you will allow me to."
If I'm allowed to take such an easy way out.
"...I will bow as many times as you want.
...But doing so would be meaningless.
It doesn't change the fact that I killed you with my own hands. That's why―――"
<Page117>
There's no way I can be forgiven.
It's not acceptable to say 'It doesn't matter because she's alive again'.
I, Tohno Shiki, have murdered the woman in front of me.
I took her life――her everything――away,
in a display of violence that has no equal.
<Page118>
"That's why―――you can take your revenge.
...I didn't run away because I was afraid of you. I was only running away from myself."
I keep my head down.
I mutter these words to myself without repenting to anyone in particular.
<Page119>
...Then, I finally wake up.
It's like I was in a dream since yesterday.
<Page120>
A transient dream before the end.
An escape from a reality where I kept running from my own cowardice.
And now, at last, the retribution...
