"I'm exhausted."
I roll over onto my back.
My heart and lungs scream with joy.
My breathing, which had been stopped for so long, finally resumes.// dropping the 'like anyone else nuance. 人並みに再開させた
<Page2>
My hands can no longer move.
I'm not even sure if I'm still holding the knife.
The only things I can be sure of are the pain all over my body, and the fact that as soon as the tension was released my consciousness began to sink into the darkness.//確かなものは全身の痛みと、気を緩めた途端、闇に落ちそうな意識だけ。
<Page3>
...I really am fortunate. My sense of pain has been numbed thanks to that.
The pain in my left foot, which I broke while gliding mid-air, would have been unbearable otherwise. It's as if every bone in my body is being sawed away. I can't even feel the pain that sparked from my eyes anymore.//そんな、目から火花が出るほどの痛みも、今はまともに感じない。
<Page4>
"But―――shit."
I don't mean to let the swear slip, but I can't help it.
<Page5>
...I don't feel anything at having survived.//生き残った余韻なんて何もない。
Nor any pride in accomplishing such a feat.
This was nothing like a miracle. It was just me slapping my emotions together after everything that had happened.//Hmm こんなのは奇跡でも何でもない。俺はただ、何もかもが終わってしまった後に、自分の感情を叩きつけただけだった。
<Page6>
"―――――The moon."
There is a waning moon in the night sky.
...I wonder why.
It's terribly familiar. I feel like I saw something similar in my dreams at least once.
<Page7>
"Are you okay, Shiki?"
<Page8>
Arcueid wanders up to me as if nothing had happened.
<Page9>
"―――Well, I'm alive, at least."
To be honest, it feels like I'm dying; even speaking is painful.
But as someone who managed to make it out alive, I cannot allow myself to voice such feeble complaints.
<Page10>
"Geez, you really don't need to be so humble.
Even if he was a newcomer, you killed a member of the Ancestors, you know?
You should be more proud of yourself."
<Page11>
Arcueid looks as happy as can be.
...Speaking practically, there must have been value in killing Vlov. Even I know that much.
But even so―――
<Page12>
...There was nothing I could do.
How far did that glacier encroach on the city? At the very least, the carnage was even worse than at the hotel, and yet I again turn a blind eye―――
"Huh? They're not dead you know.
If it's Vlov's curse you're worried about, I've got it all covered."
―――Or so I thought.
<Page13>
"W-What do you mean by that, ow...!!"
As soon as I strain myself to sit up, I feel a sharp pain in my left leg that sends me sprawling.
<Page14>
"Come on now, you need to lie down."
"Agh...! M-More importantly than that, I need you... to explain everything.
Are they really not dead...?"
<Page15>
"Yeah. When Vlov's Principle went out of control, I coated everything I could with a convective membrane.
If you had killed Vlov even a little bit later, I wouldn't have been able to keep it up."//志貴がヴローヴを殺すのがあとちょっと遅かったらフォローできなかっただろうけど
<Page16>
Arcueid readily confesses her outrageous offense.//とんでもない反則を、アルクェイドはあっさりと告白した。
...Speaking of which, at that moment.
She made a strange, sudden stop before being hit by Vlov's lance.
Was that not to protect herself, but to protect the city...?
<Page17>
...Yeah, that's right. If you think about it, it's strange that I'm still alive even after that cold wave had spread out.
Just as I was able to breathe in those super cold temperatures, the people of the city must also have been safe.
That's why―――
<Page18>
That's why she was in such a mess.
While I was only thinking of myself, she protected the entire city despite knowing that she would be at a disadvantage―――
<Page19>
"W―――Why would you do something like that?!
Didn't you say that you don't care about humans?!"
In a fit of unknown rage, I yell thoughtlessly at the carefree figure in front of me.
Arcueid curiously raises and lowers her eyebrows, and then...
<Page20>
"Well, that's because it was what you wanted."
She says something incredibly stupid.
<Page21>
"――――――"
...Did I, say that?
When? Where? Maybe it was...
<Page22>
"But you're kind of different. After all, you've never even drunk blood before.//Ref 05_00_ARC05_4.txt:L84
In that case, it's fine. Whether you're a vampire or whatever else, as long as you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay."
<Page23>
―――I don't believe this.
'If you don't lay a hand on any of us, it's okay.'
She did it because of that?
Even when she could have been destroyed with one wrong move?
<Page24>
"Ha..."
I laugh at the absurdity of it.
I'm even more stunned than I was before.
I'm stunned, but more than that, I'm more grateful than I've ever been.
<Page25>
...I close my eyes.//目蓋 but I don't think people close their eyelids
With this, I think I can go to sleep now.
My chest, which until just now had been filled with nothing but regret, is now swathed in relief.
My consciousness fades away.
I forget the pain in my legs and fall into a deep sleep.
...And then.
<Page26>
I'm forcibly snapped back to reality by Arcueid bonking me on the head.//The audio line is a bit comical, feel like bonk fits.
"...What... are you trying to pull?"
<Page27>
"You can't. If you fall asleep with a wound like that, it will be all the more painful when you wake up right? You should close the wound before you go to sleep. It'll be more efficient."//眠るのは傷を塞いでから
<Page28>
―――It's a flawless argument.
I wonder who told her that?
<Page29>
"...Arcueid. Can I give you some serious advice?"
"Hmm, what is it?"
"You know. You should stop saying such absurd things, you stupid woman."
<Page30>
That's my limit.
With that, I've really used up all my energy.
<Page31>
My consciousness fades.
Arcueid is making a fuss about something, but I don't have the strength to open my eyes anymore.
<Page32>
"Ah... hold on Shiki, are you really going to fall asleep...?"
...I told you that I was sleepy.
I'm falling asleep, not dying. I'll be sure to wake up when morning comes.//死ぬ前に眠るから、朝になったらちゃんと起きるよ。
<Page33>
"Are you really going to? That's definitely going to hurt. Do you really not need any healing? I'm sure you'll faint when you wake up."
―――Oh, shut up.
I'm going to sleep, so if you want to do something then just do it.
<Page34>
"Ok, if that's the case then you should've told me that earlier."
After hearing that cheerful voice.
I feel cold fingertips, even colder than my frozen body, touch my skin in a caring manner.//Reified this slightly 今の自分の体より冷たい
At the pleasant sensation, an expression of joy overtakes my drowsy countenance.//心地いい感触に、眠気より歓びが顔を出す。
<Page35>
"Spoils of war? Or rather, the Ancestor's remains?
Well, whatever! I was worried about where to throw it away anyway!"
...Slime?
<Page36>
"W-W-What, what was that feeling? Did you apply something just now?!
Ooh, ow, oww, the pain is coming back!?
It hurts a lot, no, it's itchy, or rather, it's scary!
What the hell are you―――"
<Page37>
Right as I was about to ask what she was doing, I was struck by a tremendous feeling of emptiness.
<Page38>
Was that shouting just now the last remaining heat in my body?
This time, my consciousness goes into a deep sleep without fighting back.
<Page39>
"It's okay, this stuff isn't bad. I'm just using it to plug up where your flesh has been gouged.//削げた肉の分だけならこれで塞がるわ。
But I can't do much about the bones. You should definitely see a human doctor afterward."
The cold fingertips are withdrawn.
<Page40>
"Did you fall asleep, Shiki―――?"
―――Yeah, I really am asleep.
It's been a while since I've had such a deep sleep―――a sleep that wasn't so dreadful.
<Page41>
"It can't be helped. Your house is the mansion on top of that hill right?
I'll find a way to bring you home somehow."
―――I simply gaze fixedly at the white moon as I sleep.
<Page42>
"...You've done well, Shiki. And thank you.
I was saved tonight thanks to you."
<Page43>
Words of gratitude that didn't seem to carry any weight in the slightest.
I can't hear her voice any longer.
This time, undisturbed by anyone, I fall into a deep sleep.
