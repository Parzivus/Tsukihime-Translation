"Well, I guess it's my turn now.
To tell you the truth, I forgot to ask you something important too."
"...? What do you mean, surely there's nothing to ask me. I am nothing like a vampire, just a simple student."
<Page2>
"Hmm. Then let me ask you something, Shiki.
If that's the case, how on earth did you kill me?"
"What?"
<Page3>
"I'm asking you what kind of method you used to kill me.
My antibodies can render secret arts like Runes and Kabbalah useless, yet somehow you managed to nullify them――― The only magecraft I haven't experienced yet are the ancient Shintoism of this country and the hidden treasures of South America."
<Page4>
"No, even those wouldn't be able to go so far as to outright 'kill' me.
Answer me, Shiki. What kind of Mystery did you use to incapacitate me?"
<Page5>
"Hold on, what do you mean when you say 'Mystery'?"
I can tell that Arcueid is being serious.
But I don't understand what she's trying to say at all.
<Page6>
"I'm talking about a Conceptual Weapon.
A catalyst for storing history and ideas.
There are magical artifacts in this country too, right? Although they are mostly Buddhist staves, swords or jewels and masks used as Mystic Codes――― Hey, Shiki, are you sure you're not someone that's involved with that sort of thing?"
<Page7>
"I already told you, I'm just a regular student. I don't know anything about those kinds of things."
<Page8>
"You're lying. There's no way that a human that's not a mage would be able to hurt me.
...Shiki, there's something that you're hiding from me, isn't there?"
<Page9>
Arcueid glares at me like an angry cat.
But even if she looks at me like that, I have nothing to tell her―――――
―――Wait, there is something.
<Page10>
"...Sorry. To tell you the truth, there is one thing.
......But I'm not sure if it's relevant here."
<Page11>
Arcueid continues to glare at me.
There's no way to get out of this without telling her everything.
<Page12>
"I don't know how to explain it... but I can see lines in things that can be cut."
"Lines that can be cut?"
I know, right? Normally, people wouldn't believe me even if I told them.
In fact, it has always been that way.
<Page13>
"...What do you mean by that?"
Arcueid asks back in all seriousness.
<Page14>
"What I'm saying is that I can see the lines along which things can be cut.
Whether it's a living thing or the earth's surface, as long as I can touch it, then it can be cut. It's like a crack, and if I run a blade through it, it will easily split into two.... does this make any sense?"
<Page15>
"It's convenient to be able to cut steel with a knife, but it doesn't mean that I can cut wherever I want. I can only cut areas where a line is visible, so I wouldn't be able to use it for things like carpentry.
Like the time I sliced you... well, you can see how I could cut a woman's skin with a knife, right?"
<Page16>
"――――――"
"......"
A chill runs down my spine.
She stares at me head-on with such a strong gaze that I stop breathing.
<Page17>
"I see. I thought the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception only existed in fairy tales, but I guess they do exist.
Mutated monsters like you, for example."
<Page18>
"Wha... what are you talking about? A vampire like you has no right to call me a monster!"
"A monster is a monster. Even among vampires, there are none that possess the Mystic Eyes that can see the death of things."
<Page19>
"The death... of things...?"
"What else could it be?
Shiki. Your eyes must have a connection to a place that should not be connected to any living thing... Are those eyes something you were born with?"
"...No, they've been like this for a long time, but they're not innate."
<Page20>
"In that case, you must have experienced death at least once before, right?"
"I'm not like you, so it's not like I can just simply die.
...But yes, I have. I almost died in an accident once. It was only after that incident that I began to see those lines."
<Page21>
"Hmm. You must have had some sort of latent power, but I suppose that was the incident that awakened it... Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, huh.
If that's the case, then of course you'd be able to kill me."
<Page22>
With a huff, Arcueid pouts and averts her gaze from me.
I'm grateful that she's no longer looking at me with visible disgust in her eyes.
<Page23>
"Arcueid... do you know what those lines are?"
"I can't tell you what you're feeling as well as you can, but I can try to explain it based on my own knowledge."
<Page24>
"What you are seeing is the end of all things, the spots where things easily die. Or to put it more simply, the time in which all things end... otherwise known as 'death' itself."
"――――"
<Page25>
That's...
...A little different from my understanding, but it's close to what Sensei taught me when I received these glasses from her as a child.//Association of receiving the glasses changed to help flow
<Page26>
...The end of all things. The future of things.
Until now, without realizing it,
I've been trying so hard not to be aware of this fact―――
<Page27>
"...What are you talking about? These lines that I see, aren't they just things that I can cut?"
<Page28>
"Like I said, those lines are 'death' itself.
Listen to me, Shiki. Every single thing in this world has an end.
When exactly that time comes will vary, but there's an end nonetheless.
Death is not something that comes, it is something that is part of you from the moment you are born, and eventually manifests itself. It is simple cause and effect. You've heard of the law of causality, haven't you?"
<Page29>
"If we were to go by that, everything that has a beginning must have an end. The flow of atoms, that's conservation of energy, right? The system will not tolerate a single irregularity; not even the smallest error.//ruby dots <こ|・><こ|・>
I mean, if such a thing existed, the whole premise of this universe would collapse. It would pop like a bubble."
<Page30>
No, even if that's true.
Isn't talking about the death of the universe a bit over the top?
<Page31>
"It's not over the top at all!
I'm not kidding when I say that your eyes really are that bad!"
"――――――"
<Page32>
"Listen. Everything in this world is predestined for extinction.
Even the strongest and the longest life must abide by this rule. Even if there is someone that has a lifespan longer than that of the universe, it doesn't mean that they will keep on living forever."
<Page33>
"This pre-determined 'annihilation' is the 'death' of all things.
Since it has always been there, if you have the power to understand the concept of 'death' and possess a Circuit bridging your brain and eyes, it is not impossible for you to see it."
<Page34>
"That is the true nature of the 'lines' that you see.
If I were to theorize about it in human terms, I'd say that it's something resembling an intrinsic flaw in atomic bonds.
Or maybe it's more like a telomere, a self-destructive genetic switch, that manifests the cause of an individual's death."
<Page35>
"Anyway, what you're seeing are the 'seams of life', the embodiment of death itself.
I don't know how you've been able to live all this time in such a state. You must have had a very tranquil heart, Shiki."
<Page36>
Arcueid speaks plainly.
"――――――"
To be this insensitive, it's beyond the point of being a joke...
While I do understand her explanation, I don't want to agree with any of it.
<Page37>
"There's no way something like that exists, much less that I would be able to see it."
<Page38>
"But you can see it.
Normally, a creature would be killed if you cut off its head. It would stop moving since it was decapitated after all.
Conversely, you would say that a creature that can't be decapitated is unkillable.# Oh, well, I guess that applies to me but let's just leave that aside for now."
<Page39>
"What I'm trying to say is that you can defy that rule.
Even if you are dealing with an opponent that nullifies every external factor, you will kill them first. An opponent that is killed must be in a 'dead' state afterward, right?
It's not that you were able to kill them because you severed their head.
In your case, you kill the thing, and thus, the object becomes severed as a result."
<Page40>
"See, if that's not a monster, then what is?
You say that it's just a line that can be cut, but those two eyes are more unique than any other ability that has ever existed until now.
You know, Shiki. You have the ability to kill everything around you, it's as if you have the eyes of the Grim Reaper."
<Page41>
"........."
...It's true.
That's why I've been trying not to be aware of it, and not to acknowledge it until now.
<Page42>
The truth is that I've known this for a very long time.
Just like Arcueid said, these eyes and this life can't be anything but some kind of mistake in this world.
<Page43>
Because ever since that day, I've been shown the end of the world.
I've been shown the possibility that everything could fall apart in a second.
As long as I'm alive, I'm surrounded by it.
Smothered by these portents of death.
<Page44>
"...But now what.
Then that means I can kill even someone like you. I can kill anything, because I'm a dangerous guy after all."
"Really? Then let's give it a try."
<Page45>
Arcueid turns off the lights in the room and moves to the window.
The curtains are opened.
The previously hidden profusion of lights and details comes into view.
The moonlight streaming through the window casts the shadow of a pale figure.
<Page46>
"Come on, it's fine so don't hold back.
Oh, could those glasses be preventing you from seeing them?"
<Page47>
"―――It's okay, right?"
...Impossible.
I bring my hand up to take off my glasses, something I've never done in front of anyone else before.
<Page48>
...I guess I've fallen into despair after suffering Arcueid's indictments.
Spurred on by my violent feelings, I take off my glasses.
<Page49>
Lines start to wriggle around the room#.# ...The world becomes full of the signs of death#.
<Page50>
"――――――#Eh?"
What stood before me was a miracle that made me doubt my own eyes.
<Page51>
Outside the window was a white moon.
The lines that were difficult to look at during the day in the blazing sun,
can now be seen with ease under just the faint illumination of the moon.
<Page52>
Among them.
The 'lines' on Arcueid's body were so thin and insubstantial that I could only see them if I were to squint my eyes and focus all of my attention on them. It was a peculiar sight to behold.
<Page53>
"But―――how?"
<Page54>
"What do you think? The lines are almost invisible, aren't they?
During the night, I am a creature without a fixed time of death.
So it would be almost impossible to kill me even with those eyes of yours."
<Page55>
"Mmm, but even then, I suppose you might still catch a small glimpse.
Although I cannot die at night, it is still possible to kill me during the day. It's due to that weak point that I was killed by you. There is also the fact that I had just finished a big task, which made my resistance to instant death lower."
<Page56>
"As a result, I was killed by your hands, and as you can see, I've grown weak to the point where I can 'die', even at night.
In other words, although I am no longer immortal, Shiki, would you be able to cut the lines on my body?"
<Page57>
"――――"
...I wonder.
It's true that I can cut anything if a line exists.
But I don't think I'll be able to cut them as deftly as I did back then in less than a second.
<Page58>
"I think it will be hard to do... The lines keep appearing and disappearing, so I could only do it while you are asleep."
<Page59>
"I know, right? That there is your biggest flaw.
No matter how much you see 'death', it is meaningless if you can't reach those 'lines' with your own hands.
No matter how weak I get, my physical ability will never fall to the point that you could catch me."
<Page60>
...I see.
Now that she mentions it, I wouldn't be able to keep up with a fast-moving animal, much less catch it.
If I can't even catch a target, then touching its lines would be out of the question.
<Page61>
In other words, even if I can see these 'lines', it doesn't mean that I can kill a moving target.
The fear that had gripped me lessened somewhat at these words, and I was able to laugh off my inhuman nature.
<Page62>
Yes, it's a funny story. A joke that brings me a sense of comfort.
No matter what metaphors or shortcomings I am taught, the world that I've been looking at my whole life will not change.
In this world, I am a defective part that mustn't be allowed to join in with the others.
<Page63>
Aah, but even so――――
How can I give any thought to such ordinary concerns,
when I gaze at the unimaginable sight before me.
<Page64>
A beautiful flower suffused with moonlight.
...That's right. It's not that I want eternity.
I just wanted to live holding on to the hope.
The hope that even a person like me could feel something―――
<Page65>
"―――Ow."
I feel a headache coming on.
Looking at all these lines gives me a headache. I put on my glasses, switching back from that miraculous spectacle to my ordinary vision.
<Page66>
"........."
Arcueid is staring at me with suspicion.
<Page67>
"...What is it? Is there something else you want to say?"
<Page68>
"No, it's not like that.
Do you not see the lines if you wear those glasses?"
<Page69>
"...Well, yeah.
They were given to me by a person I met a long time ago when my eyes became like this.
Nowadays only the lenses are original, but thanks to these I'm somehow able to lead a normal life."
<Page70>
"Is that so? I see.
No matter how strong your mind is, you would go insane or gouge out your eyes if you had to look at death all the time."
<Page71>
"...Look here. You've been spouting off about some disturbing stuff for a while now. At the very least give me a break. Also, you're close. Stop. Just stop right there. I'll throw a vase at you if you don't stop!"
<Page72>
Sensing danger, I back away.
However, my threat was entirely ineffective against the big cat in front of me, and Arcueid continues to prowl nearer with a keen curiosity.
<Page73>
"Hey. Those glasses, let me see them."
"―――No way. These are important to me, I'm not handing them over."
<Page74>
"It's not like I'm going to break them.
Come on. It's okay if I just take a look, right?"
<Page75>
What kind of stupid nonsense is she saying...
I――――
C:> Give up and hand them over.
C:> ...No, I'm not handing them over.
