It's been three minutes since the start of homeroom.
The replacement teacher for Toyama-sensei has not arrived.
<Page2>
The classroom is buzzing and order is breaking down.
To be more specific, students are all over the place.
<Page3>
Everyone in the class thinks that if we are going to be left like this, we should play until the first period starts.
One more minute. Let's just hold out for one more minute.
Just as we were creating an unspoken agreement to do whatever we wanted afterward, the door swung open.
<Page4>
"Okay, everyone, let's settle down, settle down.
Homeroom is starting!"
<Page5>
The buzz in the air instantly calms down.
The teacher who walks into the classroom is a person that I had never seen before, a person who is not Japanese by any means, and in fact, looks like a university student. An unexpected visitor.
<Page6>
"Huh? What's up with this atmosphere?
Everyone froze up all of a sudden...
What am I, a basilisk woman?# Oh wait, that metaphor is a bit obscure, isn't it? Erm, in Japanese terms, maybe something like the girl from 'The Ring'? But Sensei's name isn't Sadako, you know." //I don't think "basilisk" needs quotation marks or capitalization.
<Page7>
'Isn't that metaphor a bit old?', I thought in my head while raising an eyebrow.
Meanwhile, the mysterious woman stands at the podium without a hint of concern and clears her throat deliberately.
<Page8>
"Nice to meet you all. I'm Aizome Noel and I'll be substituting for Toyama-sensei now that she has transferred.
We'll be hanging out for only a month, but I'm looking forward to working with you all."
<Page9>
"I'll be teaching Phys Ed and English, my favorite food is Mont Blanc, the best gift I could receive would be cash or web money, and my taboo word is 'Pet Shop'.
I'm always open to questions, so feel free to come after me, okay ♡."//she literally she says attack,  質問は随時受け付けますので、遠慮なくアタックしてください♡」
<Page10>
"――――――"
A faint noise echoes through the classroom.
It was the sound of the boys as they unconsciously rose from their chairs after receiving a wink from Noel-sensei.
I have to admit that I am taken aback as well.
<Page11>
Noel-sensei is not a strikingly beautiful woman.//ノエル先生は目を見張るような美人ではないが、
But it's like she's within our reach.//その分手が届く範囲の憧れというか、
Or she has that kind of big sister aura.//ちょっとだけ年上のお姉さんというか、
Or maybe she's filled with a charm that can't be put into words.//言葉にはできない魅力で満ちているというか、
All that to say: she has this quality, like that of a fluffy meringue, which can stir up the desires of the high school boys the moment they lay eyes on her.//とにかく、一目で男子高校生の憧れを刺激する、ふわふわしたホイップのような何かがあった。
<Page12>
"I have a question! How old are you, Noel-sensei?"
"More importantly, where do you live?"
"I want to know how you spend your days off and what your hobbies are!"
"Or rather, what is your favorite type of high school student?"
<Page13>
Immediately, a storm of questions erupts from the boys.
These topics are usually discussed in an anonymous forum, but the guys who were hit by her wink couldn't even wait for that.
<Page14>
The girls stare at them coldly with a gaze that says 'boys are pathetic'. But the feverish boys couldn't care less about the scorn of their classmates, who are getting fed up with even being in the same room as them.//女子たちは“男子サイテー”と冷めきった視線を向けてくるが、熱に浮かされた彼らにとって、見飽きたクラスメイトからの軽蔑なんてどうでもいい問題らしい。feverish as in frenzied, in a trance, crazy about (Noel). I modified 見飽きる to "fed up being in the same room", I just couldn't word it well enough with "getting sick of looking (at them)", the whole sentence was just so awkward.
<Page15>
"I love the eager-to-please attitude, thanks guys!//トビウオみたいな反応、ありがとう。Dobiuo is a flying fish, it's also used in ドビウオ女 as a contrast to マグロ女 ("tuna women", starfish, dead lay), and means that she's eager to please (in bed, but apparently also in general). I don't have, and there may not be, anything to keep the reference (and while マグロ女 is pretty famous, ドビウオ女 seems to be really obscure honestly). Need to add italics to "please" when possible
Ehh, the girls would probably expose my age anyway so let's just say I'm 25 years old. I live in a rented apartment two stations away, my favorite type of men are the mature, artistic type. My hobby is helping out at the church on Sundays. It's the church in the next town over, so if you're interested, I'd be happy if you'd come over and pray."//えー、年齢はどうせ女子のみなさんが暴いちゃうだろうから言っちゃうと25歳、住まいは二駅となりの賃貸マンション、好きなタイプはオトナな頭の文系男子、趣味は日曜教会でお手伝いをしています。となり街の教会だから、興味があったらお祈りにきてくれると先生嬉しいな」
<Page16>
"Church? What are you, a Sister? I mean, are you a Sister as a hobby?"
"Yep. It's not that uncommon in my country. Well, I'm still a volunteer though, just trying to resolve the confessions of troubled lambs, you know."
<Page17>
"Oh... oooh..."
The boys are stunned by Noel's unexpectedly good response.
I, too, am a bit intrigued by the novelty of the word 'Sister'.//かくいう自分も、シスターという言葉の目新しさにはちょっとだけ食いついてしまった。drawn, interested, intrigued
<Page18>
Meanwhile, the girls are silently fiddling with their phones.
I casually check the anonymous bulletin board for students.
<Page19>
'What's with that, boys are so stupid...'
'Is she really that beautiful?'
'I wonder if she's half French or something'
'I mean, isn't that woman a little too blatant?'
<Page20>
...There you have it.
There is a lot of negative talk on the board.
<Page21>
Thus, the class has become a mysterious space divided into simple factions of 'boys' and 'girls'.
In other words, we have gone back to the primitive age of middle school students cursing each other, saying stuff like 'boys are terrible' and 'girls are annoying'.
<Page22>
She looks at the situation with a warm smile and says,
"Ufufu. I wonder if these kids are alright in the head." //Reads better following the expression "right in the head."
The new teacher makes a scathing remark.
<Page23>
I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere of the classroom so I looked away, making eye contact with Yumizuka in the process. She seems not to be in it as well, looking as absent-minded as I am.
...What is this atmosphere?
The classroom is abuzz. What seemed to be a peaceful day has taken an unexpected turn.//色めきたつ教室。平穏と思われた一日は、予想外の展開を迎えてしまった。
