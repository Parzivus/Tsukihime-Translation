...I wake up in the gray daylight.
I no longer hear the sound of raindrops.
The rain has stopped, but the sky still looks cloudy.
<Page2>
"Ha―――a"
I take a long breath and get up from the bed.
<Page3>
...I couldn't sleep properly last night.
Every time I was about to fall asleep, 'that scene' replayed itself in my mind and woke me back up.
<Page4>
"...A bright red floor, pieces scattered everywhere..."
Reason and memory are inconvenient in these situations.
They try to remind you of all the things you want to forget.
<Page5>
"...This is ridiculous. That was a dream, how many times am I going to have nightmares about it?"
<Page6>
...Yes, it was just a dream.
I want to forget about it as soon as possible.
<Page7>
There is a knock at the door.
The clock reads just before six.
...Who could it be this early in the morning?
<Page8>
"Excuse me―――#Shiki-sama?"
<Page9>
"Pardon me. I see that you are awake."
<Page10>
"No worries. I'm sorry for surprising you too. I've been asleep since yesterday evening, so I woke up early.
...So, what's up with you, Hisui? You're here so early, did something happen?"
<Page11>
"........."
Hisui falls silent as if she is perplexed.
Looking closely, I notice my school uniform in her hand.
<Page12>
"Did you bring me a change of clothes?"
"...Yes. Once again, I apologize.
For making you see something so unpleasant."
"?"
Hisui falls silent.
...I don't think there was anything unpleasant, but I look past it.
<Page13>
"...But thanks anyway. You can leave my uniform there. I'll head down to the living room in a minute."
"Understood. Now if you will excuse me."
<Page14>
Hisui heads for the door without a sound.
...However.
She pauses in front of the door and abruptly turns around.
<Page15>
"Shiki-sama... well, if you have time, I can prepare a bath for you."
"...A bath, in the morning?"
<Page16>
"Yes, you are quite dirty. I suggest you clean yourself before heading to school."
<Page17>
...Now that she mentions it, my body is rather dirty.
Yesterday, I was lying in the park with anemia, so I guess it's not surprising.
<Page18>
"You're right. I'm sorry, but could you prepare it?
At this hour, I'm sure I can make it to school on time."
<Page19>
"Understood.
Then please come to the bathroom in around 20 minutes."
<Page20>
Hisui leaves the uniform and walks out of the room.
The time is still six in the morning.
I stare up at the ceiling of my room for 20 minutes without doing anything.
<Page21>
As I pour water on my head, my dull thoughts finally clear up.
I soak my hair in the cold water, taking a deep breath.
<Page22>
...It was really a disgusting dream.
It's crazy that I dreamt about killing a woman that I didn't even know.
Even if I'm exhausted from living in an unfamiliar mansion, if I'm having dreams like that, I can't imagine what the future holds.
<Page23>
"...That's right. I have to pull myself together."
I pour cold water on myself again and wash my body.
"Ouch......"
As the towel touches my throat, it starts to throb.
<Page24>
"...What is this?"
I look at my neck in the mirror.
...Weird.
My throat is red and swollen.
