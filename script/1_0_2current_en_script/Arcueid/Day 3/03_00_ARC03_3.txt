It's before homeroom.//　ＨＲ前。
The classroom is livelier than usual.
<Page2>
The boys and girls are having silly arguments over Noel-sensei.
Fortunately, I don't belong to either camp. I just saunter across the classroom to my seat without a care in the world when―――
<Page3>
"Yo. You're late, Tohno."
My window seat is occupied by a man who doesn't belong in a morning classroom, waiting for me with a smirk on his face.
What's more,
<Page4>
"Good morning, Tohno-kun."
He is accompanied by an unexpected guest.
<Page5>
"Senpai? Why are you in this classroom?"
<Page6>
"Oh, is it that unusual? I just dropped by to see if you were in class."
"It's pretty unusual. Normally, upperclassmen don't come to lower year classrooms. Isn't it embarrassing to be in an underclassman's class as an outsider?"//「珍しいコトです。普通、上級生は下級生のクラスには来ませんよ。下級生のクラスとか、もろ異分子って感じで恥ずかしいじゃないですか」
<Page7>
"Is that so? Tohno-kun, you're pretty fixated on small details. But I'm fine with it. We're all from the same school anyway."
What philanthropism. I'm at a loss for words.//　なんという博愛主義、ぐうの音も出ない。
<Page8>
"No, but the third- and second-year classrooms are still quite far apart... and you'll be late for homeroom if you don't go now."
'I see', she nods earnestly.
<Page9>
"Don't worry about that. I'm a fast runner, despite my appearance. It takes me less than a minute to get to my class downstairs."
'Ahem', she replies, puffing out her chest.//　えっへん、と先輩は胸を張る。
"......"
Senpai is tough, both mentally and physically.//　精神的にも肉体的にもタフすぎる先輩だった。
<Page10>
"You talk too much, Tohno.
It's fine, she can be here if she wants to..."//　いいじゃんか、先輩が好きで来てるんだからさー」
<Page11>
Arihiko, for his part, has plopped himself down on someone's desk, happily chatting with Senpai.//　有彦は有彦で、人の机にどっかりと腰をおろして先輩と楽しげに話をしているし。
<Page12>
".....Okay. But you have to go back to your class two minutes before homeroom starts, Senpai."
I sit down on my chair with a sigh, feeling somewhat tired all of a sudden.
<Page13>
"...Inui-kun, Tohno-kun seems to be in a bad mood, huh."//「……乾くん、遠野くんはご機嫌ななめみたいですね」
"...Yeah, I think that he's having a temper tantrum because he doesn't like living in a new place. He doesn't mind most things, but he has a bad habit of lashing out when he doesn't understand something."
<Page14>
"...Is that so? He doesn't seem like the type to get angry."
<Page15>
"...No, that's not true. He looks all docile, but when he goes off, he really goes off. Rather often. In a snap."//「……いや、そんなコトないんだなこれが。遠野はおとなしそうに見えるだけで、爆発する時は爆発するんスよ。わりと頻繁に。パチっと」
"...Hah. Snap, you say?"
<Page16>
"...Yeah, yeah. Once he loses his temper, he's indiscriminate. Don't trust him, even if you're his upperclassman."//「……そうそう。一度キレると見境がなくなるから、先輩もこいつを信用しちゃダメだぜ」
...The two of them are whispering 'secretly' to each other.//　……二人はひそひそと内緒話をしている。emphasis mine, "内緒話" needs to be worked in somehow and it fits with the following lines.
<Page17>
"...You know what? If you want to talk in private, can you do it in the hallway? I can hear what you're saying and it's giving me a headache, you know."//「……あのさ。内緒話なら廊下でしてくれないか？　人の机でそういうコトされても、まる聞こえで頭痛いんだけど」"人の机" dropped.
"No way!! You heard me, Tohno!?"//「なんと、聞こえていたというのか遠野!?」
<Page18>
...I heard you.
He even pretended to be talking in private, approached Senpai, and casually extended his hand to her waist, only to be struck down mercilessly.
Rather than getting angry, I was depressed by such a blatantly theatrical performance.
<Page19>
In the meantime, Senpai is covering her mouth with her hand in surprise. I wonder how serious she really is.
...She might have thought that she was really talking in private.
<Page20>
"Oh, that's why you're a liberal arts four-eyes. Listening in on me and Senpai talking about our love affair is just beyond pathetic... #Hmm, are your days really that filled with frustration? Is your new sister reaaally that beautiful? Can you introduce me to her next time?"//「オゥ、これだから文系の眼鏡クンは。オレと先輩のラ・マンな話を盗み聞くとか哀れにも程がありますなァ……。んー、そんなに日々欲求不満なんですかー？　新しい妹サマはそんなに美人なんですかァー？　今度紹介してくれますかー？」
"Arihiko, seriously, are you trying to start a fight with me?"//「有彦。ようするに、俺に喧嘩を売ってるんだな？」 literally closer to "Arihiko, let me get this straight, are you trying to sell me on fighting you?"
<Page21>
"Of course not. You and I are the best of friends! I'll fight with my parents if I don't like them, but I won't fight with my best friend, that's my policy. Basically, I'm a man who lives by a code of chivalry."//「そんなワケないだろ、オレと遠野は輝かしい友人じゃないか！　気にくわなけりゃあ親とだって殴り合うが、親友とだけは戦わないってのが<信念|ポリシー>なワケ。基本、<侠|きょう>に生きる漢なんだ、オレ」
<Page22>
Well, aren't you great...//　凄いな、それは。
In his head, chivalry means that it's okay to raise your hand against your own flesh and blood.
<Page23>
"I see. That's a rotten policy you've got there."
"Hey, you're pretending to be down, but you're really the same old Tohno! Sheesh. You had me worried!"
Smack. my self-proclaimed best friend hits me on the back.
<Page24>
"...You've been watching out for me, huh?"
"Don't ask such a silly question, dummy.
Isn't it noble to do such things casually?"
Smack. he hits me on the back again.
...We've known each other for a long time, but I still can't get a full grasp on his personality.
<Page25>
"So, how's the new house?
From the looks of it, you're under a lot of stress."#"Who knows. I had this strange dream last night and when I told the people in my house about it, they didn't believe me."//Scripted line break. 見たところ、ヘヴィにストレス溜まってそうじゃんか」「さあ、どうだろう。とりあえず昨日は妙な夢を見て、家の人たちに白い目で見られたけど」
"Hmm. I see, that's unfortunate."
Arihiko makes a serious face and nods.
<Page26>
"........."
―――And then.
While I thought that she was just staying out of it, Senpai was staring earnestly at me and Arihiko having a trivial conversation.//　黙っていると思ったら、先輩は俺と有彦がくだらない会話をしているのを真剣に見つめていた。somewhat liberal translation with the first clause.
<Page27>
"Senpai?"
"Tohno-kun, you're really close with Inui-kun, aren't you?"
"Are you serious? If you think so after seeing that, there must be something wrong with your glasses."
<Page28>
"That's not true. You're much more open when you're in front of Inui-kun. You seem to trust him a great deal."
For some reason, Senpai smiles happily.
"?"
Arihiko and I look at each other and tilt our heads.
<Page29>
"I really envy you. I wish I had friends who could understand each other without all the fervor."//「羨ましいなあ。そうやって何の気負いもなしで分かり合える友人がいるのって、憧れます」"really" added to make it more casual
Senpai breathes out in approval.
""Is that so?""
Arihiko and I look at each other, furrowing our brows.
<Page30>
"Well, it seems it's about that time. I'm going back, but before I do, Tohno-kun, did you see the news this morning?"//「と、そろそろ時間ですね。わたしは戻りますけど、遠野くん、今朝のニュース見ましたか？」
"Oh... I've been so busy that I forgot. I haven't seen it yet."
<Page31>
"I see. Well then, let me ask you directly. There was a large mansion on the news this morning. Was that your new house?"
"Eh?"
<Page32>
Now that she mentions it, I remember Hisui saying that the police came by to question us.
<Page33>
"Ah, yeah, that was definitely my house.//「ああ、それはきっと<家|うち>のコトかもですね。
I heard that the police came by to talk to us this morning."
"I see. Tohno-kun, you shouldn't play around too much at night."//「そうですか。遠野くん、あんまり夜遊びしちゃダメですよ」 夜遊び is "nightlife" but I don't actually have a better translation than this on hand.
<Page34>
Senpai quickly walks away.
We watch her depart in silence.
<Page35>
"Mm-hmm ―――Now then, hey Tohno."
"What is it? I won't answer you if it's something stupid."
"It's not stupid. The million-dollar question is, when did you become so close with Senpai that she started coming to see you?"//「つまらなくはないぞ。大きな疑問として、オマエはいつのまに、先輩の方から会いに来るほど親しくなってたんだ？」
<Page36>
"It's hard for me to answer that question. We've only just started talking recently. Today was just a whim, wasn't it?//「俺に訊かれても返答に困る。話をするようになったのはここ最近だし、今日だって単なる気まぐれなんじゃないか？
I mean, you seemed friendly with her too."
"Not really. It took a whole week just to get to the point where she remembers my name."//「そうでもない。オレは七日もかけてやっと名前を覚えてもらったレベルだよ」
<Page37>
"Huh, that's unusual. Isn't it your policy to avoid dealing with women who don't fall for you in a day, because they're a pain in the ass?"
<Page38>
"With most women, sure. But Senpai is different.
I've been keeping it a secret, but the truth is, I prefer..."
"You're saying you like older women who look good in glasses, right?"
Arihiko's cheeks redden.
<Page39>
"Do you get it, buddy?"
"I know. It's a bit of a stretch, but Senpai said you and I are best friends. I can tell when you're serious.//「わかるよ。眉唾だけど、先輩が言うには俺たち親友らしいし。おまえが本気かどうかぐらい読み取れる。
She's really cute. It'd be weird if you didn't end up interested in her after a conversation. The same goes for me too."
<Page40>
"I see, I see.
So you understand how great she is as well―――wait.# What did you just say?"
"If we're best friends, we'll get along with each other and have similar interests. It's not surprising that we share a type."//「親友なら気が合うものだし、なにより趣味も似通うもんだろ。好きな女の子のタイプなんて、もろかぶりになっても不思議じゃない」
<Page41>
We stare at each other for a while.
Finally, Arihiko nods solemnly and says,
"It was a short friendship, Tohno."
"Yeah, it was."
Waving my hand, I see him off.
At the same time, the bell sounds for the start of homeroom.
