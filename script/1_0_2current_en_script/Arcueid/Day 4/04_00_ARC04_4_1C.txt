―――I'm attacked by a headache.
Needles bounce around in my eye sockets.
A painful red sensation denies what I just witnessed.
<Page2>
"...Come on. I just wasted even more energy."
<Page3>
The woman looks back at me with her shoulders slumped in disappointment.
From the start, she had no interest in the corpses that have just vanished.
<Page4>
"This is all thanks to your dawdling.
If you had decided sooner, we never would have been found in the first place!"
<Page5>
The woman briskly walks up to where I am sitting on my backside, having fallen.
The black panther has long since disappeared.
Maybe it saw what she just did and ran away, thinking it was no match for her.
<Page6>
"Hey. What was that just now?"
...A headache forms behind my eyeballs.
The pain penetrates my skull and disrupts the language center of my brain.
What the hell―――is this woman?
<Page7>
"Hm? You mean that? That was just a corpse, right?"
"Those are familiars that belong to an enemy vampire. It's a bit unusual... or rather, it's the first time I've seen this type."
"No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you."
<Page8>
The sharp headache urges me to come to my senses.
This woman is a monster.
The black panther that's out of place in a modern city,
and even the impossibly burning corpses,
both seem far more believable when compared to this woman.
<Page9>
Creating a tornado by simply waving her arms? This is ridiculous. As a fragile human being, there's no way I can live with such a thing for even a second.
<Page10>
"Me? I already told you that I'm a vampire.
Wait, are you telling me that you don't know the meaning of the word 'vampire'?
I thought it would be common knowledge in Japan."
<Page11>
The woman gives an idiotic response.
I take this opportunity to put some strength into my trembling limbs.
During all the commotion, she had moved away from the alleyway entrance.
If I run as fast as I can, I might be able to escape this time.
I take a deep breath.
<Page12>
"Huh...?"
"――――――"
<Page13>
Just as I was about to run, I see her face.
This time, I really calm down.
<Page14>
"H-Hey. What's the matter, are you hurt somewhere...?"
"There's no way that I could be hurt. I just never thought I'd be hit by something that slow."
<Page15>
"...But things are starting to take a turn for the worse.
At this rate, it seems that I have no choice but to ask you to be my shield no matter what."
<Page16>
"―――What?"
Now that she mentions it, she did talk about that...!
I thought it was a metaphor of some sort, but I'm not so optimistic anymore.
This woman is seriously asking me to act as a shield against things like that black panther and those burning corpses...!
<Page17>
"D-Don't say such stupid things, you idiot!
You saw what happened, what can I possibly do? You would be much better off on your own!"
<Page18>
"That's not true at all. As of right now, I really am completely drained.
To put it in your terms, it's taking all my effort just to survive, or something like that."
<Page19>
"――――――"
I-Is that so? It really doesn't look like it, but I guess it's true.
I'm relieved to know that the violence from earlier is not infinite and that there is a limit to her actions.
Ah no, that's not what I should be thinking about now...!
<Page20>
"Hearing you say that you're at your limit bothers me. ...If it's something that I can do, then I'll do it.
But I can't. It's impossible, no matter how you look at it. I'm not strong enough to stop something like that. I'm sorry, but I can't become your shield."
<Page21>
"Bullshit. You were the one who killed me.
Why are you making up such lies after doing all that?"
<Page22>
"Killed you? That was―――"
That's when I realize that I don't know what I'm talking about.
If I can be useful, then I'll do whatever I can to help.
But the standard of being useful is way beyond normal.
<Page23>
"........."
"...Hmm.# If that's the case, all you have to do is keep an eye on me while I'm asleep.
You can do at least that much, can't you?"
<Page24>
...I don't know why I feel so weak when she gives me that look.
I―――
C:> ...will help.
C:> No, I will never cooperate.
