...It doesn't seem like she's going to give up.
Or rather, if she gets any closer, it will definitely end in a scuffle. If it comes to that, there's no doubt that I'd be the one to get knocked down.
<Page2>
"Geez, I get it, here!
...Listen. Give it back as soon as you're done looking at it."
<Page3>
I hand the glasses over to Arcueid.
She thoroughly scrutinizes them inside and out.
...And then,
<Page4>
"Shiki. The person that gave you these, are they still in this city?"
"...I don't think so. It was seven years ago, and she didn't seem like the kind of person who stays in one place."
<Page5>
"―――I see. Good, it would be a bother to deal with another opponent.
...Although it would be safer not to deal with Blue in the first place."
Arcueid falls silent with a serious expression on her face.
<Page6>
"Arcueid. You know Sensei... no, the person who made these glasses...?"
<Page7>
"I do. She is one of the four Magicians that exist in this world.
These glasses are an extraordinary piece of craftsmanship. I wouldn't be able to break them with my current strength, although I'm not very strong right now."
Arcueid's face grows more and more serious.
<Page8>
"...Wait, were you planning on breaking them?"
"―――Huh?
Did I say something like that?"
<Page9>
"...So you really were planning to break them."
'Give them back,' I said, taking the glasses back from Arcueid.
<Page10>
"Geez. You were the one who said I'd go insane without these glasses.
Or are you telling me that you want me to go crazy?"
<Page11>
"No, that's not it.
It's just that I didn't like how much you cherished them."
"........."
I have no idea what goes through a vampire's head.
This woman must be trying to destroy my life, in one way or another.
<Page12>
"...Whatever, just don't get any more crazy ideas.
The memories of Sensei are precious to me, but more than that, I wouldn't be able to live without these glasses. If I get headaches from seeing these lines all the time, who knows what will happen to my head."
