The night is drawing to a close.
While Arcueid is perched on the bed,
I sit on the sofa, aimlessly staring at the clock.
<Page2>
The time is a little after four in the morning.
There's only about an hour left before dawn.
<Page3>
"One more hour, huh?"
There hasn't been anything unusual so far, and Arcueid herself hasn't shown any signs of being nervous.
The hotel is completely peaceful.
<Page4>
...In a sense, that also made me a little uncomfortable, but in the end it seems as though it was a needless worry.
For some reason, I have a feeling that this night will continue to pass like this.
<Page5>
"Hey, Shiki."
Arcueid calls out to me for the umpteenth time.
<Page6>
"What do you want? There's nothing for us to talk about anymore."
"Are you sure? Since we're here, it'd be a waste to just sit around and do nothing."
<Page7>
"...Arcueid, how long do you think we've been talking for at this point?
It's been six hours. Six. If you were to ask me what's more tiring, talking with you easily beats out standing guard."
<Page8>
Arcueid glares at me with displeasure.
That's right.
For whatever reason, Arcueid is talking to me a lot.
<Page9>
If you're feeling weak then you're better off going to sleep but―――
"It's much more fun to talk"
or so she says. Inevitably, the two of us end up facing each other like this.
<Page10>
"......Hah."
I really don't understand what goes through her head.
To make matters worse, my stomach is growling.
Now that I think about it, I haven't eaten a thing since breakfast yesterday, nearly 24 hours ago.
<Page11>
"If you're hungry, why don't you eat something?
Since we've come all this way to stay at a hotel, you could have just ordered some room service."
<Page12>
"No thanks, that would lower my tension. In fact, aren't you the one that should eat something? Since you're weak and you refuse to sleep, you should have a meal at the very least."
<Page13>
"If you aren't going to eat then I won't either.
Of course, there's some value in having a normal meal, but it would be boring to just be eating alone."
<Page14>
"A normal meal? I don't think meals are particularly normal or special―――"
...Oh, that's right.
It doesn't look like it at all, but Arcueid is supposed to be a vampire.
If that's the case, then sucking human blood would be her way of having a 'meal'.
<Page15>
Arcueid did say that vampires need human blood in order to survive.
By that logic―――whose blood has this woman sucked before, and consequently, how many humans has she killed?
<Page16>
"――――"
I take a quick glance at Arcueid's face.
...This is ridiculous.
Even though it's been explained to me numerous times that she's a vampire, I just can't imagine her sucking someone's blood―――
<Page17>
"What? Is there something on my face?"
"...!"
I look away in panic.
Arcueid stares deeply into my face,# and lets out a smile as if she had discovered something profound.
<Page18>
"You're curious, right?"
"A-About what?"
"About how many people's blood I've sucked until now. Do you want to know?"
"Ngh..."
<Page19>
...She has completely seen through my thoughts.
Arcueid's smile is so broad that it makes me somewhat uncomfortable.
I don't like the feel of this―――but despite that, I can't help but wonder how many people this woman has killed.
<Page20>
"...That's right, I'm curious. I'm working with you after all.
If I don't even know that much, I won't be able to predict when you might have a change of heart and attack me."
<Page21>
That is a real issue.
Arcueid shows signs of having understood my argument.
<Page22>
"In that case, here's a question.
How many people's blood do you think I have sucked so far?"
<Page23>
With a tap, Arcueid springs lightly from the bed and walks over to the window.
<Page24>
"How many? That's―――"
Arcueid smirks and looks at me with amusement as I fall silent.
It's obvious that she's trying to provoke me.
<Page25>
...Fine, I'll give you a straight answer.
Since we're talking about this weird woman, I'm sure that number is―――
C:> Ten people...?
C:> One hundred...?
C:> One thousand...?
