All right, let's go to the tea ceremony room.
I heard that Ciel-senpai dropped by this morning, so I might be able to meet her there.
<Page2>
"But, before that..."
It's not a good idea to go there empty-handed. Let's take a little detour.
<Page3>
It took me longer than I thought to get the necessary supplies.
I knock on the door of the tea ceremony room.
After a few moments, the door opens and Senpai appears.
<Page4>
"Oh, it's Tohno-kun."
She tilts her head in wonder.
<Page5>
"Senpai. Would you like to have lunch with me?"
"Lunch?
I'm glad that you invited me, but―――"
<Page6>
This doesn't look good.
Perhaps she has other things on her mind, but she seems to be pondering whether to accept my invitation or not.
Well then, I have a little trick for that.
<Page7>
"I brought curry bread though."
"Eh―――?"
<Page8>
Senpai's expression brightens visibly.
...What is this? I don't mean to be rude to her but that's really cute...
<Page9>
"What do you think? I'll give it to you in return for yesterday's lunch, so why don't we eat together?"
<Page10>
"Oh, that's very kind of you, thank you.
...That's right. If you just want to thank me for yesterday, then there's no reason for me to refuse."
While fiddling with her glasses, Senpai steps aside and lets me enter the tea ceremony room.
<Page11>
"Please make yourself comfortable.
I've just prepared some tea."
<Page12>
Senpai steps into the next room.
I guess that's the kitchenette.
<Page13>
"Ah..."
When I entered the tea ceremony room, the reason for Senpai's hesitation earlier becomes clear.
There is an empty lunch box on the tatami mat.
It seems that she has eaten lunch already.
<Page14>
"Tohno-kun, would you prefer green tea or black tea?"
"I'll have some green tea, please.
Anyway, Senpai, did you eat lunch already?"
<Page15>
"Yes, a little while ago. I overslept today, so I didn't eat breakfast. I was very hungry this morning."
<Page16>
"...I see. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I'll eat in class, so please take your time."
<Page17>
"Eh―――so you're not giving me any bread?"
Suddenly, Senpai peers out from the kitchenette. Her face is like that of a child who didn't receive a present on Christmas.
<Page18>
"No, I mean... you're full, aren't you, Senpai?"
"That's not true. I'm starving."
<Page19>
She responds immediately.
It doesn't sound like... she's paying attention to me at all.
<Page20>
"That's fine then. But are you sure you're okay, Senpai?
This curry bread is pretty big, isn't it?"
"Don't worry about it. If it's something I like, I can eat it without any reservations."
<Page21>
I already figured that out from yesterday.
The shy smile on her face is probably not due to her embarrassment of having a second helping of lunch, but rather, she is genuinely looking forward to eating the curry bread.
<Page22>
"........."
...She's a mystery.
I think the fact that she is so happy about a single piece of curry bread makes her a rare commodity nowadays.
<Page23>
After Senpai ate a piece of bread, and I ate two, we decided to have some tea to wash it down.
I sit down on the tatami mat and leisurely enjoy a cup of tea with her.
<Page24>
"By the way, I saw the news this morning.
Tohno-kun, how is your new home? It seems that something serious has happened..."
<Page25>
"The news?"
...Ah, I remember Hisui saying that the police had come over to ask questions about those bloodstains.
<Page26>
"That news had nothing to do with us. My impression of the mansion was that it was very nice on the inside and that there were noisy wild dogs at night.
If anything, I'd say the lack of a TV and a Japanese-style room is a problem. There's no place to drink tea like this."
<Page27>
"A wild dog? What's with that? Isn't the incident that happened in front of your mansion a part of those serial killings?"
"No, if it was, it would've been a bigger deal than that.
There were no incidents, just some bloodstains.
...Well, but――"
<Page28>
That place is where I went to see the wild dogs late at night. ...I couldn't say that though.
<Page29>
"No, it's just a misunderstanding. Whatever it is, it's none of our business. Since I can finally relax with you here, let's not talk about unpleasant things."
<Page30>
"That's not true. At any rate, we live in this city so I think we should keep the serial killings in mind! Tohno-kun, you lack a sense of danger in my opinion!"
Senpai raises her voice to exaggerate her point.
She is the very image of a reliable upperclassman scolding an unscrupulous junior.
<Page31>
"But the only danger is going out at night, right?
There have been eight victims already, so the police will probably catch the culprit soon."
<Page32>
"Oh, no. If you keep talking like that, you'll get attacked while your guard is down.// Lit. expression 'to cut the head off a sleeping person'
The news has been saying the same thing since the third case, but in the end, the culprit hasn't been caught yet, you know."
<Page33>
...She's right about that.
The fact these murders continue to occur to this extent in modern Japan is beyond abnormal and may even be considered paranormal.
<Page34>
"...That's right. It's just that I didn't feel like it was something I should concern myself with because of the joke about modern vampires. ...It was indeed careless of me. I also live in this city so I have to be careful as well."
<Page35>
"Yes. As long as you understand, it's all right.
Really, you shouldn't be following strangers all the time. ...If the culprit is a psycho who enjoys being treated like a vampire, you might look like easy prey.# You give off the impression that you might be a delicacy for some reason."
"...No, um, Senpai? I'm not sure if that's a good comparison."
<Page36>
Don't say such ominous things.
I have chronic anemia, so I'm probably not a good target for vampires in the first place.
<Page37>
"But if you think about it seriously, it's strange, isn't it? They called them a vampire but why did they give them that nickname?"
"The bodies were entirely drained of blood, weren't they? It's not wrong to use vampire as a comparison, is it?"
<Page38>
"...I don't think so. It's common knowledge that people who have their blood sucked by vampires become vampires as well.
And yet, the bodies of the people who were killed are still there, and they are not walking around as vampires. You don't need to go to the trouble of giving it a horror story nickname, a simple murder case should be enough."
<Page39>
"Tohno-kun, do you really believe that there are vampires?"
"...Listen here. I just went along with it because that's what the news is saying. If there really were vampires, as I said before, they wouldn't leave any dead bodies."
<Page40>
"That's true. But can't you also think of it this way?
The corpses that have been found were people that died because they couldn't become vampires.//ruby dots <な|・><れ|・><な|・><か|・><っ|・><た|・><か|・><ら|・>
There are two types of people, those who can become vampires and those who can't. If a person that can become a vampire is attacked, their body will never be found. That's because even now, they will be living on in secret somewhere."
<Page41>
"Haha. That's a horror story, isn't it, Senpai?"
"Yes, it's more a horror story than anything else.
Unfortunately, we have not reached the ending."
<Page42>
With a smile, Senpai sips her cup of tea.
While we are talking about such trivial things, the lunch break ends.
<Page43>
Senpai said she still had some things to clean up, so I go out into the hallway ahead of her.
Accepting her kindness, I turn my back away from the tea ceremony room and start to head back to my classroom... when suddenly.
<Page44>
"Arara, is that you, Shiki-kun?
I'm surprised to see you in a place like this."
I bump into Noel-sensei in such an unexpected place.
<Page45>
Noel-sensei is holding a silver accessory in her right hand.
Is that a cross... I wonder.
<Page46>
"Ah, this? I told you, right? I'm doing this little side job to keep myself busy.
It's too noisy in the other wing, so I went to the quiet club building to do my daily prayers.
Anyway, what are you doing here?# Do you have a secret meeting place around here by any chance?"
<Page47>
"Eh... no, that's―――"
I can't just say that I was here to see my upperclassman from the tea ceremony club.
<Page48>
"No, I was just walking around to take my mind off things.
I haven't had lunch yet, so I thought I should go back to the cafeteria."
I try to keep my tone as natural and as vague as possible.
<Page49>
"My, my. You're like a college student who can afford to take a walk before eating. Shiki-kun, are you aiming for a music college or something?"
"No, I'm not interested in music... but why?"
<Page50>
"Hmm,# I'm just asking!
Okay then, bye-bye! To the cafeteria you go, hurry up or lunch break will be over ☆!"
<Page51>
'See you later', adds Noel-sensei with a wink, and then softly presses her lips to the silver accessory in her hand.
Pitter patter pitter patter. The sound of her hard shoes disappears into the back of the club building.
