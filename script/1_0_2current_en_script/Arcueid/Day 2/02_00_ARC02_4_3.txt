<Page1>
No, I'll just stay in my room.
It would be a shame to lose this feeling of satisfaction by walking around since my body is now nicely relaxed after taking a bath. //Gramatically, I think there should be a comma after "around," but I think it breaks up the flow of the sentence a little too much.
Then, with a thump, I throw myself on the bed.
<Page2>
"Shiki-sama, are you there?"
"Nha!?"
I jump out of bed in a panic.
I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I feel like I was being accused of mischief.
<Page3>
"O-Of course I'm here. Please, come in."
"Yes, excuse me then."
<Page4>
"I am here to make the bed.
I am aware that it is unpleasant for you, but please excuse me for a moment."
<Page5>
It's not unpleasant at all.
It's a luxury to have someone make the bed in your room.
However, I have learned in the past two days that if I mentioned that, it would trouble her.
<Page6>
"Thank you. I'll be quiet in the corner of the room, so don't worry about me, please."
<Page7>
I move to the corner of the room so as not to disturb...
"........."
Hisui pauses for a moment, then silently begins and finishes making the bed.
<Page8>
The bed is as clean and neat as if it were brand new.
"Your bed is ready. Excuse me."
Hisui bows lightly and heads for the door.
<Page9>
"Ah, wait a mi―――"
I stop her to thank her for making the bed.
I have no intention of grabbing her, but I reach out to touch her shoulder.
<Page10>
In a flash, Hisui's hand knocks mine away.
"Ah..."
I'm surprised, but she looks even more shocked than me.
<Page11>
"...Sorry. I was trying to stop you, I just..."
I guess I'm feeling a little too relaxed after taking a bath.
I felt like I was back in the Arima house and misjudged the distance between us.
<Page12>
"...No. It is I who should apologize.
I am not used to being touched... Please forgive me."
<Page13>
Hisui's shoulders are trembling feebly.
I think that's a bit excessive, but still, I'm the one who frightened her.
<Page14>
"Anyway, sorry... it's just, I felt like you'd leave if I didn't stop you."
Hisui would have stopped just by my call. But earlier, for some reason, I had a feeling she wouldn't stop for that.
<Page15>
"No. You have nothing to apologize for.
It is I who is at fault. Please forgive me for offending you."
<Page16>
"No, you didn't offend me at all... but I guess I was really surprised. Hisui, you reacted so fast."
She reacted as fast as a kendo practitioner would.
If this were a dojo, I'd be applauding.
<Page17>
"Well, that is... I guess it is because I usually take care of the mansion."
Hisui lowers her gaze in embarrassment.
...Good. It seems that she understood that I was praising her.
<Page18>
"...I deeply apologize. I must have not heard you calling for me earlier.
What can I do for you, Shiki-sama?"
<Page19>
"Ah, well―――"
It's hard to say 'I just wanted to thank you for making my bed.'
I just need to find some other topic... Ah, that's right.
<Page20>
"I was wondering how Akiha is doing. Her school is a boarding school, right?"
<Page21>
"It is indeed.
It is true that the school Akiha-sama attends is a boarding school. However, as an exception, she is allowed to go to school from home."
"...#You mean she goes to school from this house?"
<Page22>
"Yes, but she is rarely able to make it home before evening like today. After a full day of schoolwork, she has lessons to attend, so it is usually at least seven o'clock by the time she returns to the mansion."
"Lessons to attend? Such as...?"
<Page23>
"Today, she attended violin lessons along with foreign language studies."
Today? ...Is she on such a schedule every day? She's been forced to practice a lot by the old man for a long time now, so it's probably not a surprise, but...
<Page24>
"In addition, until bedtime, she has to approve the Tohno Group's business report for the day. After waking up and until breakfast time, she goes over the details of future business activities."
<Page25>
"―――Seriously?"
It really is amazing.
Not only her mind and body, but even her lifestyle is made of steel. //I can't figure out the best place to put "also" here, nothing feels quite right.
<Page26>
"On weekdays, she returns before dinner, so if you wish to speak to her, please let Nee-san know after dinner.
If it is a holiday, Akiha-sama may be able to take some time off. In that case, you can also let me know."
"I-I see. Thanks, that was helpful."
<Page27>
Then with a bow, Hisui leaves the room.
But then again...
<Page28>
"Violin lessons along with company responsibilities..."
The people who are actually running the business are probably the higher-ups in each department, but in the end she'll still look through all their decisions.//実際に事業を回しているのは各部門のお偉いさんだろうが、最終的に行われる“すべての決定”に目を通しているのだろう。
<Page29>
"...So being in that office is not just for show, huh?"
I feel a mixture of guilt and genuine respect.
<Page30>
In my memory, Akiha was a quiet, slender girl who always followed me with anxious eyes.
But now, she's taking over from our old man, while still managing to live her life as a student.
<Page31>
"―――I guess it's true.
People change a lot in seven years."
Just as I've become the Tohno Shiki of today in seven years,
Akiha has become the Tohno Akiha of today in those seven years.
<Page32>
Seven years is a long time.
Roughly half of my life so far.
I wasn't in this mansion during the most important period of her life when she was growing from a child to an adult.
<Page33>
"...I'm really not a good brother."
I mutter this obvious fact as if to ridicule myself.
Even though I regret it now, it's still unforgivable.
I selfishly wonder if I could have eased Akiha's burden a little if I stayed with her for the past seven years.
