...I watch the crowd in front of the station in a daze.
It's a little past two.
The bustle of the city continues unabated.
A large number of people pass by.
I don't know their names or their identities, but each of them is bound to their own destination without giving a thought to any of the people walking right beside them.//名前も素性も知らない彼らは、すぐとなりを歩いている誰かに視線を向ける事なく、自分だけの目的地に向かって行く。quite liberally translated here but I think it maintains the same sense.
<Page2>
Despite all these people being in the same place, they all continue on within the single-minded limits of their own personal journey.
Like how everyone is their own main character.
Everyone lives each day with themselves at center stage.//　彼らは彼らが主役の一日を過ごしている。Dropping "過ごしている" because I think it reads smoother without it.
<Page3>
It's all clear to them, but at the same time, they see nothing at all.//　目に見えていながら、何も見ていない毎日。lit. "It's [all] visible while in their everyday life, they see nothing". Again, quite liberal here. I think the meaning is clear in this line but open to discuss.
Their respective days do not intersect and do not branch out anew.
<Page4>
The wisdom to be able to obtain the minimum amount of order in society with the least amount of effort.//　最小の労力で最低限の<安寧|あんねい>を得る知恵。
Necessary but uninvolved individualism seems to be the path chosen by mankind.
<Page5>
"........."
Perhaps I'm feeling sentimental because of the slight fever.
"...Let's go home."
I've calmed down and hanging around here will only leave me indulging in these worthless thoughts.//　気分も落ち着いてきたし、ここにいても<善|よ>くない思索に<耽|ふけ>るだけだ。
<Page6>
I stand up from the bench and blend in with the crowd.
With my thoughts dulled by anemia, I head for the mansion.
All I want right now is to be left alone in my room. I want to take off my glasses, close my eyes, and become nothing but a pair of lungs.//　今はただ、誰も訪れない部屋で眼鏡を外して目を<瞑|つむ>って、呼吸をするだけの器官になりたかった。literally "become an organ that does nothing but breaths" which is so weird. could also be something like "a human life support machine" but that is a little too liberal imo.
@g ―――That is, until I crossed paths with that woman.
<Page7>
"――――――"
@gI thought that time had stopped.
@gEvery fiber of my being commits that instant to memory.//@g　俺のすべてが、吸い寄せられたように、その一瞬を記憶する。
<Page8>
@g―――Ba-dump.
@gGolden hair and red eyes.
@gWhite clothes. A white figure.
@gA snowfield with no footprints.
@gAn unblemished silhouette, reminiscent of a sacred mountain beyond human comprehension.
<Page9>
@g―――Ba-dump.
@gMy pulse rises.
@gMy heart beats erratically.
@gMy veins and arteries are invigorated.//@g　静脈と動脈が活性化する。
@gMy nerves split one after another. My spinal cord heats up in hallucination.
<Page10>
@gTo say that I was entranced would understate my obsession.//@g　見惚れていたというのなら、間違いなく夢中だった。
@gMy feet were already stopping.//@g　足はもう止まっている。matching with past tense
@gI turned my head to follow the woman who had walked out of view.//@g　俺は視界から過ぎていった女の影を、見失わぬよう振り返る。
<Page11>
"―――,―――――――――"
@gI find myself forgetting to breathe.//@g　気がつくと呼吸を忘れていた。tense promoted
@gI feel nauseous.
@gI can't breathe.
@gI'm suffocating.
@gI can't remember how to breathe properly no matter how hard I try.
<Page12>
"―――,―――――――――"
@gMy throat is burning.
@gMy eyeballs feel like they're going to shatter.
@gMy palms are wet and slippery.
@gWithout my blood doing its job, my fingertips are so cold I can't feel them.//@g　血は足りず、指先は感覚がないほど冷えているのに、
@gI'm sweating so much.
<Page13>
@gI remember that I am a living thing.
@gMy breathing restarted on its own.
@gBut the reason――――
<Page14>
         I didn't make any mistakes.
         I didn't choose anything.
         I just wanted to go home.
<Page15>
@gReason.
@gI vaguely understand now that the tightrope I tricked myself into walking has been cut.//漠然と、今まで騙し騙しこなしてきた綱渡りの綱が、これで切れてしまった事を実感した。"騙し騙し" is more strongly "using every method possible" or "using every trick in the book" but I'm not sure this line is wrong since it makes quite a lot more sense.
<Page16>
"Haa――――haa―――――haa――――"
@g...I have to chase her.
@gI have to chase that woman.
@gChase, chase, chase, and then talk.
@gI move my frozen feet.
@gMy breathing has become hot like ■■■■.
@gSeeking the figure of the <woman|p r e y  > in white.//spaces are intentional
<Page17>
"Haa――――haa――――haa――――"
@gThe woman is walking slowly.
@gShe's not interested in me at all.
@g―――A faint question crosses my mind.//@g　―――かすかな疑問が脳裏をかすめる。
@gNot interested? That's absurd. Is that really the case? But the fact is, she's not aware of me at all. Did something happen? There must have been something. She's probably very tired. Exhausted. Drained. That's why there's this opportunity. The reason I feel this way is because, when all is said and done, I'm confident that /I can ■ her/.
<Page18>
@g 	.her at sneering I'm if as her lick to want I
@gWhen was the last time I satisfied my desire.
@g 	.pieces thousand a into her tear to want I//@g@b求めるように引き千切りたい。"千切りたい。" means "tear to shreds" but I still like the "thousand pieces"
@gNot as a replacement for masturbation or intercourse, but for a simpler, more primal desire.
@g 	.her savor can I so down her cut to want I
@gI don't remember what it is. In the first place, I'm still,
@g 	.content heart's my to her ■ to wait can't I
@gI don't even remember the 'first time'.
<Page19>
@g'Haa', I let out a gasp that doesn't sound like my own.
@gI clutch my chest to hold back the boiling emotions.
@gThe woman swimming in the crowd is beautiful, both pure and desirable.
<Page20>
"―――――――"
@gMy THROAT is ACHING.//@g　ノドがアツイ。katakana (candidate for font/italics change)
@gI haven't been ABLE to BREATHE for a WHILE now.//@g　サッキからイキがぜんぜんデキナイ。 (candidate for font/italics change)
@gWhat's wrong with that? It's only natural.
@gAfter witnessing such a ■, it would be rude for a creature not to get excited.
<Page21>
@gI take something out of my bag.
@gI put it in my pocket and start to walk.
@gI feel the touch of iron on my fingertips.
@gI am truly blessed.
@gThis tool is just perfect.
<Page22>
@gHow wonderful. I'm going to climax. What a sensual rendezvous.//@g　すばらしい。いきそうだ。なんて官能的な逢瀬。
@gI must keep a good distance.
@gSo as not to be noticed.//@g　気付かれないように、
@gSo as not to arouse the suspicions of the nuisances that surround us.//@g　周りの邪魔者に気取られないように。
@gThat woman and I are complete strangers.
@gSo, as naturally as possible, I have to follow her scent.//@g　だから出来るだけ自然に、匂いを辿っていかなければ。
<Page23>
@gThe woman enters an apartment complex.
@gAn automatic glass door. The security is perfect.
@gNo one can even enter the hall unless they're a resident.
@gI go around to the emergency exit, take off my jacket, and leave it somewhere hidden. I cut. I go inside.
<Page24>
@gThere's no one in the hall.
@gI look at the elevator. The light stopped at the top floor.
<Page25>
"――――――"
@gI press the call button. I go inside.
<Page26>
@gAt that moment, I'm overwhelmed by her remaining presence.
@gThe lingering scent of that woman makes my mouth twitch upwards.
<Page27>
@gI'm trembling with excitement.//@g　わくわくする。
@gIn the tight confines of this locked room, I clutch the object in my pocket.//@g　狭い密室の中で、ポケットの中の得物を握り締めた。
@gShe's right here, near me.
@gNot much longer, I can finally ■ her.
<Page28>
@gI get out of the elevator.
@gI sense that there is no one in the hall.
@gI get out of the closed room. I head for the hallway. Not a soul in sight.
@gI can't think.
@gMy mind can only bring forth a single word://@g　ある一つの単語しか、俺の脳味噌は生み出さない。
<Page29>
@g■ that woman.//@g　女を。(note the particle)
@gTo ■ that woman.
@gAt this rate, I'm going to――――――
<Page30>
@g―――I'm in front of room number three.
@gThis must be it. All the other rooms are empty. Am I sure? Yes, of course. This sense of smell is a natural part of being an animal. I merely forgot this fact during my lazy existence. It's shameful. It's unforgivable. There's nothing I can do about it. The rules of civilized society are so gentle and harmless that such a trivial impulse can become fatal.
<Page31>
"―――,―――――――"
@gI go to press the doorbell but stop.
@gMy glasses are in the way.
@gI can't do what I came here for with these on.
<Page32>
"―――Got it?
Don't ever look at things thoughtlessly, okay?"
<Page33>
"......"
@gThere was a woman who told me that a long time ago.
@gBut now I can't remember her name or her face.
<Page34>
@gI slowly take off my glasses.
@gThe squirming lines look like the wrinkles of age.//@g　うごめく線は、老化する<皺|しわ>のようだ。
<Page35>
@gI don't know what I'm doing.
@gWhat am I trying to do?
@gWhy am I doing this?
@gWhat does Tohno Shiki... want to do with that woman from earlier?
<Page36>
@gI don't know.
@gI don't know, but I press the doorbell.
<Page37>
"Yes―――"
@gA voice comes through the door. The door opens.
@gIn that moment.
@gI slip into the room through the small gap.
<Page38>
"Eh――――"
@gThe woman raises her voice.
@gOr she tries to.
@gThe woman who I was so infatuated with, whose voice I had yearned to hear, did not last forever.//@g　これほどに執心し、こんなにも求め焦がれた女の声を聴く事は、永遠にない。
@gBefore I know it, the whole thing is over.
<Page39>
@gThe moment I enter the room, I hear a 'kaching', the sound of a hammer striking.//@g　室内に入った瞬間、かちん、と撃鉄の落ちる音を聞いた。"撃鉄" is a gun's hammer, not a regular hammer.
@gThe sound of the door? The creaking in my brain? The alarm bells of the end?
@gIt wasn't any of those. So then, what was it?
@gThere's no need to explain. It could only be one sound.
@gThe sound of the knife being released.
<Page40>
@gIn an instant, I trace the lines running along the woman's body.
@gStab.
@gCut.
@gPierce.
@gRun through.
@gCut her into pieces.
@gCompletely and utterly, I kill her.
<Page41>
@gA total of seventeen lines on her body.
@gNeck, back of the head, right eye to lip, upper right arm, lower right arm, right ring finger, left elbow, left thumb, middle finger, left breast, ribs to heart, stomach to the abdomen in two places, left groin, left thigh, left shin, left toe, all of them.
@gPassing through each, without taking even a second.
@gIn truth――――in the blink of an eye――――it's all over.//@g　真実　<瞬|またた>く間に　悉く。 these are just full width spaces in the jp.
I dismantled her into seventeen cuts of meat.//@g　ソレを、十七個の肉片に解体した。
<Page42>
"―――Eh?"
I hear a stupid, idiotic voice.
I didn't realize that it had come from my own throat.
<Page43>
I feel lightheaded and dizzy.
There are pieces of something scattered in front of me.
On the marble floor, a red liquid spreads out like an overturned bucket of water.
The revolting smell of blood.//　むせかえる血の匂い。
The cuts are very clean. There are no organs spilling out.//　切断面はとてもキレイで、臓物はこぼれていない。
<Page44>
Only the crimson invades the floor like a wave.//　ただ赤い色だけが、波のように床を侵食する。Am I overusing crimson for "赤い色"?
It's a strange story.
The room is empty, just the dismembered woman's limbs and myself, standing there.//　部屋には何もなくて、ただ、バラバラになった女の手足と、自分だけが立っている。
<Page45>
"―――What the―――"
The red encroachment is too vivid.
In my hand, I hold the murder weapon: a knife.
<Page46>
"She's―――dead."
Of course.
Anything left alive after this wouldn't be human.//　これで生きていたら人間じゃない。
<Page47>
"Wh―――y?"
There's nothing, nothing at all.
Just now, with my very own hands.
Did I, with my own hands, cut this woman I didn't even know to pieces so easily?
<Page48>
"Did I―――kill her?"
There's no doubt about it.
Or perhaps that's not the case?
I had no reason to. So no, it can't have been me. But there never was a reason from the start. That's why it's wrong, it can't be right. I'm the only one here. There was another person here a moment ago, but now I'm the only one alive. So no. It has to be. But there's no reason, there's no reason, I didn't want to, I wasn't, I wasn't in my right mind. I was never sane in the first place. So it's not, it's not―――
<Page49>
―――The red blood spreads across the marble floor.
Oozing slowly.
I can feel the red blood on my feet.
<Page50>
".........Ah."
I lift my shoes in surprise, but not in time.
The woman's red blood sticks to my feet and the floor like coal tar.
<Page51>
"―――――――"
Aaah. I-It's, blood.
Because I broke her apart, the disgusting color continues to flow sluggishly, even now.
<Page52>
"―――It wasn't me."
Yes, this has to be a mistake.
A mistake. A mistake. It has to be a mistake, nothing else.
This must be―――
C:> This must be some kind of a bad dream.
C:> ...No, this is a reality wrought by my own hands.
