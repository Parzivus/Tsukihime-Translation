<Page1>
"Yeah, it's a rather nice room.
I wouldn't mind spending an entire night in here."
<Page2>
Arcueid happily looks around the hotel room.
"――――"
I'm speechless at this turn of events.
<Page3>
"So, what do you want me to do specifically?"
"For now, let's get out of here.
My room is not suitable for protection after all... That's right, we should go to a higher place with a better view."
<Page4>
And so, here we are.
Arcueid flagged down a taxi on the main street, and we took it to the next town over.
She checked into a room at one of the most expensive hotels in the area. Not only did she rent a room... but the entire top floor as well. It was like she was a celebrity.
<Page5>
"Wow, it's so tall!
Human architecture really is advancing at a remarkable pace.
What do you call this kind of thing? 'Wringing water from a stone'? 'Rapid progress'?
Well, it doesn't really matter! Look over there, Shiki, the alleyway we were in just now has become so tiny!"
<Page6>
With the drawn curtains slightly open, Arcueid is enjoying the view from the window.
I am by no means in the mood for this.
<Page7>
This place is more like a fortress built on the top floor of a hotel than a hotel room.
The curtains that block out the sunlight, the furniture that decorates the room, and the materials used for the walls and doors are several times more luxurious and sturdy than those of most hotels.
<Page8>
Since we're renting the top floor, no other guests will come up here. There's even a monitor in the room that displays the lobby on the first floor.
...I realize once again that the people who use these kinds of rooms are from the privileged class.
<Page9>
"Let's hide out here tonight. Oh, and don't worry about the hotel fee.# I'm rich, so I'll treat you."
<Page10>
Arcueid says this cheerfully as she moves away from the window.
She said it was a great lookout spot, but it appears she is already tired of the birds-eye view of the city.
<Page11>
"...Arcueid. What on earth are you thinking?"
I let out a sigh.
<Page12>
"What do you mean, I'm thinking about a lot of things."
"No, that's not the point.
I mean sharing a hotel room with a man―――"
<Page13>
I was about to say something, but I stop.
My role here is just to be a lookout for this self-proclaimed vampire.
I don't have to say anything superfluous.
<Page14>
"No, it's fine. Do what you want."
"You're a weird one, Shiki.
You're so unpredictable, getting angry all of a sudden and then going silent."
I'm not sure what's so funny, but Arcueid is laughing.
<Page15>
"......"
Meanwhile, I'm standing in close proximity to the door, keeping my guard up as I survey the state of the room.
I'm the complete opposite of the relaxed Arcueid.
<Page16>
I'm exhausted and desperately want to rest, but if I were to sit down on the sofa now, I would surely sink into a deep sea of sleep.
No matter how desperate I get, I can't allow myself to become that defenseless.
<Page17>
"Shiki, do you want something to drink? There seem to be a lot of drinks here!"
"......"
A carefree voice comes from the minibar in the room.
...The bottle in Arcueid's hand is, needless to say, some sort of alcohol.
<Page18>
"You know, I'm underage and you're offering me alco―――"
I bite my tongue mid-sentence.
I don't know if she's underage or not. It's no real concern of mine and I don't feel like asking.
<Page19>
"I'll choose for myself later. More importantly―――"
No matter how tired or bewildered I am, there is a question I need to ask.
<Page20>
What is this woman in front of me?
In other words, how dangerous is the situation I'm in right now?
Even if the answer defies common sense, if I don't try to understand things to the best of my ability, then I can't even sit peacefully on the couch.
<Page21>
"...More importantly, there's something that I need to ask you.
After that, I can relax and rest."
<Page22>
"I don't mind, but what's the matter? You're so uptight all of a sudden."
"..."
Uptight? I've never once let my guard down in front of you... but enough about that.
<Page23>
"I'm being serious here.
At the end of the day, what are you really trying to accomplish?"
<Page24>
"Me? I'm just trying to go after a vampire.
Eliminating vampires is my duty after all."
"Yeah, you definitely did say that earlier.
But you're a vampire too, aren't you?"
<Page25>
"What, are you saying that you still don't believe me Shiki?"
<Page26>
"Don't worry, I believe you enough.
What I'm trying to say is, why would a vampire like yourself be going out killing other vampires? That doesn't make any logical sense."//ruby dots <吸|・><血|・><鬼|・>であるおまえが<吸|・><血|・><鬼|・>
"Oh, so you don't like it when members of the same group kill each other?"
<Page27>
"I wouldn't want them killing people outside that group either.
...But look, vampires are demons that suck the blood of humans, right? Then shouldn't your target be humans and not other vampires?
What you're killing is, well―――"
If the goal is to suck blood, wouldn't it make more sense to target humans...?
<Page28>
"Sucking blood and killing are two different things.
But still, I understand what you're getting at. You're saying that we should help each other because we are the same species, right?
However, even though vampires are all derived from the same greater <origin|p r o g e n i t o r  >, each one is a unique species that has evolved differently from all the others.//Ruby space intentional
They don't have the same sense of fellowship that humans do."
<Page29>
"...? You mean to say, the vampire that you're looking for is different from you?"
<Page30>
"Yeah, it's a different species of vampire to me.
The vampire I'm chasing is a Dead Apostle, so it's almost exactly the same as the image you have of vampires.//ruby dots <人|・><間|・>
They suck human blood and convert the people they kill into familiars to gradually increase their power.
You remember that burning corpse from this morning, right? That's what happens to people killed by vampires. Even though they are dead as humans, they cannot truly die and continue as the living dead."
<Page31>
"...They're dead, but they're still alive..."
The corpse that appeared in the alleyway... According to the legends about vampires, people whose blood has been sucked become new vampires and attack people.
In this way, their numbers increase and eventually, they turn an entire village into a land of death... or so it goes.
<Page32>
"Yes. That's the kind of vampire that lurks in this town.
I'm not interested in sucking blood, and I'm not one of their kind. That's why I have no problem with killing these other vampires."
<Page33>
Arcueid says this matter-of-factly.
It appears that there are many different types of vampires.
<Page34>
"...I'm starting to feel a bit shaken after all this.
So you're telling me that the reason you asked me to become your shield was so you could kill him."
<Page35>
"Yes, that was my intention at first.
I was planning to use you as a shield regardless. Even if you tried to run away, I would have bound you with my Mystic Eyes and used you through the power of overwhelming fear.
But as I was talking to you, I started to change my mind."
<Page36>
...So she was planning to use force from the beginning.
Okay, I'll have to make sure to remember that.
"But why did you change your mind?"
<Page37>
"Hmm, it's because I was wrong about you.
You know, Shiki. From when I was killed by you up until the time I restored myself, I thought that you were a member of the Church.
If that were the case, there was a chance that you knew the location of the enemy and could be counted on as a force to be reckoned with."
<Page38>
"But in the end, you were just a completely normal person. You didn't know anything about vampires, let alone where the enemy's coffin was."
<Page39>
"...Yeah, there's no way they'd send an executor to an atheist country like this in the first place. Not to mention that they wouldn't be operating alone. Their policy is to always move in master-disciple pairs after all..."
<Page40>
Arcueid mumbles to herself.
The conversation has been derailed, and I am left behind with a pleasant feeling.
<Page41>
"Anyway, it means that my target is no longer you but my 'original prey'.
Which is kind of a bummer, I guess."
<Page42>
She says something disturbing in a lively voice.
...Damn. She still has something against me, this woman.
Even though it's natural for her to hate me after what I did, it's not good for my heart to hear her say 'I want to kill you' with a smile.
As I thought, she is going to kill me the moment I let my guard down―――
<Page43>
"Are we done with the serious stuff? Well then, time for bed!"
"Wha?"
And then,# with a bounce in her step,# she walks over to the bed and flops down on it.
<Page44>
"This feels pretty good, so I'll sleep until the sun goes down.
Ah, Shiki, you should also get some rest while you can. Vampires can't be active during the day, so it'll be during the nighttime when I need you to be a full-on lookout."
<Page45>
"...You. Do you understand that you've just said something that negates your entire existence?"
"Don't worry about it.
―――Oh, I think I've reached my limit. With that, good night Shiki. Wake me up when the sun goes down, okay?"
<Page46>
"H-Hey!"
"――――――"
Arcueid suddenly falls asleep like a car that's had its engine turned off.
<Page47>
"―――――Seriously?"
Unbelievable. She's really asleep...
I feel like an idiot for standing close to the door so that I could escape at any time.
<Page48>
Is this okay? I know it's not for me to say, but is that woman really fine with this?
I'm in a situation where I've been brought here somewhat against my will. But now, I could easily make my escape.
<Page49>
No, to begin with,
even though I don't have the same urges I had back then,
"...I've already killed you once, you know..."
Despite this, how can she fall asleep so carelessly, this woman.
<Page50>
"......"
I stare at Arcueid's face.
Observing her well-rounded chest as it rises and falls, it would appear that she is breathing.
The body lying on the bed does not move a muscle.
<Page51>
She looks like a work of art in repose.
Softly closed eyelids.
Long eyelashes, and pretty lips that look vibrant even without lipstick.
<Page52>
The swell of her chest is very shapely.
The line of her hips is like a hill disappearing into the horizon.
Her smooth and slender legs are stretched out across the bed.
Demure yet sensual; such contradictory words come to my mind.
<Page53>
"......"
A woman like that is fast asleep and defenseless in this royal suite.
I've only known her for a short time, and yet she trusts me, the person who brutally killed her, from the bottom of her heart.
<Page54>
"What an idiot, this woman."
...Yeah, she's so stupidly honest it's enough to make you worry for her.
<Page55>
In any case, this is a critical juncture.
This may be the final crossroads where Tohno Shiki has a chance to turn back.
<Page56>
She said 'I'll have you be my shield'.
But I...
C:> ...Enough with the madness. Let's run.
C:> ...No more getting lost. Let's stay.
