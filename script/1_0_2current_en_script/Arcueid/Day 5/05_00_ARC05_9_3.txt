It has to be towing.
That's the only way. A brilliant idea if I do say so myself.
Yes, if we can't get to him, then we'll have him come to us.
<Page2>
It'd be impossible for me to do it alone, but if Arcueid still has just enough power left, we might be able to swing it...!
<Page3>
I run back toward Arcueid.//Same as 05_00_ARC05_9_1.txt
"Shiki―――!"
I hear the sound of ice being smashed behind me.
The claw-shaped wind pressure generated by Arcueid seems to be accurate not just within her reach, but even at this distance.
<Page4>
"Why did you come over here, Shiki?
And why do you have such a proud look on your face?!"
"I'll explain later, so just do that thing!
The ivy you caught Vlov with earlier!"
<Page5>
There's no time to spare.
I shout while gesturing my intention to tie Vlov up with the ivy.
<Page6>
"From this distance?!# Ah, that was close...!"
"I need you to somehow use it as a lasso!"
"Huh?! Geez, I don't get it, but I just have to catch him right?!"
<Page7>
My desperation must have come across since, despite her confusion, Arcueid raises her hand toward Vlov and―――//Not 100% strict usage of the confusion but reads better imo こちらの必死さが伝わったのか、アルクェイドは訳が分からないながらもヴローヴに向けてその手をかざし、
<Page8>
"That's it! You're amazing, Arcueid!"
"Ehehe. But what do we do now?"
<Page9>
"That's obvious―――pull as hard as you can!"
"As hard as I can, like this?!"
<Page10>
Given how forcefully Arcueid can throw debris around, she should be able to reel in Vlov at high speed.
This method is much faster than if I were to run.
<Page11>
The question is to what extent Vlov has the power to stand his ground.
There's no way he would let go of his distance advantage. He will definitely resist Arcueid's pull with all of his strength.
<Page12>
This is a tug of war between two vampires.
The weaker one will be pulled into the other's position―――
<Page13>
"―――Eh?"
In an instant. The black cloak 50 meters away vanishes.
Faster than we can prepare ourselves, the enemy we came to defeat appears before our eyes.//倒すべき敵 expanded a bit
<Page14>
Nowhere is safe down here.//空間 relating to the pit? Or immediate surroundings, in which case more like 'there's no longer any safety buffer'? この空間に安全圏はない。
It's not that Vlov didn't want to approach us, but that he didn't have the strength to do so, just like me.
But despite this, I gave him a tailwind.
<Page15>
"―――, Ah."
A massive foreign object pierces my chest.
I take a deep breath for the last time.
<Page16>
"―――Are you not aware of the basics of hunting?
The rope should be secured only after killing the prey."
I hear the voice of a hunter disappointed from the bottom of his heart.
<Page17>
I blew it.//まったくだ。
I leapt at such a hare-brained plan with no regard for my own life.//命も使わず? 自分の命も使わず、安易な思いつきに飛びついた。
A fitting end for an idiot no better than a stray dog.
