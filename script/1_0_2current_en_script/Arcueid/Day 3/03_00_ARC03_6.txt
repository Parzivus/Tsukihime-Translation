...Somewhere, I hear the sound of rain.
It's a prolonged, quiet drizzle.
<Page2>
"―――――"
I'm dizzy.
My throat hurts when I breathe.
"It... hurts."
A voice comes up.
"――――Shiki-sama?"
Just then, I hear someone's voice and presence nearby―――
<Page3>
"It's―――my room."
Before I know it, I'm lying down in my own room.
I put on my glasses from the bedside table.
<Page4>
"Good evening, Shiki-sama."
"Hisui...?"
"Yes. How are you feeling?"
"......"
<Page5>
Hisui asks me a strange question.
There's nothing particularly wrong with my body―――
<Page6>
"Wh―――y?"
Yes, why?
Why am I sleeping in a place like this―――?
<Page7>
"I―――that woman―――I ki―――"
I almost said 'I killed someone' but I cover my mouth.
That's the only phrase that my reasoning stopped me from saying.
<Page8>
"Hisui... why am I here?"
"...Do you not remember, Shiki-sama?"
Hisui slightly raises an eyebrow.
<Page9>
"We received a call from the school saying that you had left early. However, you did not come back in the evening so my sister went to look for you and found you resting in the park."
"The park―――the park nearby?"
<Page10>
"Yes. You were resting on a bench and then walked back to the residence on your own."
"...No way. I don't remember that at all."
<Page11>
"I do not think it is so strange that you do not remember.
Your consciousness could have been clouded by weakness as a result of your anemia."
<Page12>
"........."
...I don't remember any of that.
But there is no reason to doubt what Hisui said.
<Page13>
"...Ah, it's already nine o'clock at night. ...I didn't notice it at all."
"Yes. When you got back here, you said you wanted to rest in your room. I tried to call for a doctor, but you said, 'This happens all the time'."
<Page14>
"―――I see.
It's true that my anemia is always a problem, but―――"
<Page15>
...It was different this time.
I've killed someone―――no, wait.
<Page16>
"Hisui. What did I look like?"
"―――Pardon?"
"I mean my clothes. My shirt, my shoes, there should have been blood―――"
They were all wet and sticky.
<Page17>
"If you are talking about your uniform, it was dirty so I washed it."
"You're telling me you washed those bloody clothes...?!"
<Page18>
"...It is true that it was covered in mud, but there were none of the bloodstains that you speak of. Besides, it was only your shirt and pants that were dirty. Your jacket was not particularly dirty."
<Page19>
"――――――"
...Unbelievable.
Even though I was kneeling in a pool of blood and my legs and arms were bright red...?
<Page20>
"Shiki-sama, did you have a bad dream or something?
You seemed like you had a terrible dream earlier, and your face is still pale even now."
Hisui is staring at me intently.
<Page21>
"That was―――a dream?"
Was it all a dream?
That feeling.
The smell of blood.
That ethereal woman in white.
"Yeah―――you're right. That must have been a bad dream."
<Page22>
I let out a long sigh.
――――That's right.
It was all a bad dream.
It's not like I was going to break a promise I made to Sensei when I was little and do something like that for no reason.
<Page23>
"Aah――――I'm awake now."
"If you are feeling up to it, I can prepare dinner for you."
<Page24>
"Eh... no, dinner is..."
...Even if that was a dream, I still can't get the color and smell of blood out of my mind.
<Page25>
"I'm sorry, I don't feel like it.
I'm going to sleep like this tonight. More importantly, Hisui."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"About that. You told me that I came back in the evening. Did Akiha say anything?"
<Page26>
"Akiha-sama was not present at that time. She came home about two hours ago and I informed her about your condition."
<Page27>
'What about it?' Hisui asks silently.
<Page28>
"It's nothing, really.
I've been here for three days, and I'm sure she's tired of the trouble I've caused her."
<Page29>
"...It is true that Akiha-sama's mood became worse, but I would not say that she is tired of you."
After saying that, Hisui takes a step back.
<Page30>
"Now, if you will excuse me.
If you need anything else, please let me know."
<Page31>
"Ah, thank you―――And I forgot to ask one more thing."
"Yes, what is it, Shiki-sama?"
"It's raining outside, isn't it? I was wondering when it started."
"It started before you arrived. When my sister found you, you were soaked."
<Page32>
"........."
I see. I don't even remember that happening.
It must have been the severe anemia... if that's the case, I should've just rested at school instead of pushing myself.
<Page33>
"Good night. I'm really sorry about today.
Please tell Kohaku-san I said thanks."
"Understood. ―――Please have a good night."
<Page34>
"―――Haah. So it was a dream."
...The words I muttered were utterly empty.
It doesn't feel real at all.
The realization that what I was thinking,
was actually a dream.
<Page35>
Outside, there is the sound of rain.
My head still feels a little heavy.
I look at my chest.
...The old scars from seven years ago are still clearly visible, like burn marks.
<Page36>
"...Ah."
On the desk in the room is a knife, a memento from my father.
"―――――"
...It was a dream.
It was nothing more than a dream.
I close my eyelids, repeating the same phrase, as if to deceive myself.
<Page37>
...I let out a breath as if I'm trying to clear my lungs of the scent that I've taken in.
I give in to the dark sleep that severs my consciousness.
<Page38>
When I was a child.
I think someone told me not to tell lies that I couldn't even fool myself with.
