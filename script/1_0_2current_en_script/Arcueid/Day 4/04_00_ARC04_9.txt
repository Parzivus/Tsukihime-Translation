"Ten people... maybe that's too few...?"
"Yeah, that's not even close at all."
"Mmm. Then how about a hundred?"
"Bad luck, that's a miss again."
"Gh...! In that case, a thousand!?"
"Nope, that is also a big no-no."
<Page2>
Arcueid makes a strange chuckling sound.
...I'm not angry at all, so why do I feel so incredibly frustrated?
<Page3>
"Well, I didn't think it would be this high, but surely it's not ten thousand...?"
"That's also wrong. Ten, hundred, thousand... so this is what you really think of me huh. How awful, do you really think I'm like other vampires?"
<Page4>
"...Am I wrong? I thought all vampires were the same.
Even humans get hungry just by simply existing. So if you vampires need to suck blood in order to survive, then wouldn't there be no limit to how much you need?"
"That's true. What you said is right, but..."
<Page5>
"As for myself, I don't think I've sucked blood even once in the past eight hundred years. On top of that, I've never killed an ordinary person either."
<Page6>
――――.
Even a person like me understood that this was a strange thing for a vampire to say.
But, more importantly,
<Page7>
"Hold on, you're joking right?"
"I'm serious. Besides, sucking blood is really scary for me."
<Page8>
"You're afraid of sucking blood, even though you're a vampire?"
"In all honesty, I'm just a coward.
That's why no matter what happens, I'll always be a half-vampire."
<Page9>
Arcueid mutters as she looks up at the night sky through the window.
The woman in white continues to stare at the sky for a while longer.
Viewed from behind, her figure is as indistinct and hazy as that of a phantom.
<Page10>
"...I see. A half-vampire, huh."
I put a hand on my chest as I mutter those words.
...Huh? This feeling... Am I relieved...?
Why is that, I wonder. That doesn't make any sense.
<Page11>
"What's wrong, Shiki?"
"No, it's nothing. I was just laughing at you because of how much of a cowardly chicken you are."
"Chicken? Why would I be a bird like that?"
<Page12>
Arcueid tilts her head in confusion.
You'd never think she was a vampire with this appearance.
...That's right. Of course I would feel that way.
Because it's clear that the person in front of me isn't a bad person at all. There's no way I wouldn't be relieved.
<Page13>
In any case, if I were to believe what Arcueid says, then I have no need to worry about being killed at random.
That's why I feel safe... I feel safe, but more so than that important fact, there's something else I'm relieved about.
<Page14>
...Geez, what am I thinking?
To think that my feelings would be so misdirected that I'd be happy about the fact Arcueid is only a half-vampire.
<Page15>
"...Huh?"
Perhaps because I've relaxed as a result of the conversation with Arcueid, I feel a sudden dizzying headache.
<Page16>
"?"
A white haze clouds my vision.
This is... not the usual chronic anemia.
My consciousness is still intact.
I just have a faint headache and a strange chill―――
<Page17>
"What's wrong, Shiki?
You've got so much sweat on your forehead."
"...Sweat?"
<Page18>
As she says that, I wipe my forehead with my hand. I'm sweating so much that my hand comes away wet, just like Arcueid said.
...This is strange. We aren't in a sauna, I shouldn't be sweating like this.
With rising unease in my chest, I look over at the digital clock in the room.
<Page19>
The clock reads 4:32 AM.
The temperature has dropped to 11℃ with the morning chill.
This sweating is strange for such a temperature.
<Page20>
No, actually―――
This room feels as hot as a midsummer heatwave...!
<Page21>
"Arcueid. Aren't you feeling hot?"
"Not really, it's not hot enough to cause any problems with my movement. It's only a mere 38℃. Although I'm weaker than usual, my body can still handle temperatures of up to 3000℃."
<Page22>
It was stupid of me to ask.
3000℃? Can you not even burn a vampire with a blowtorch!?
<Page23>
...No, there's no time to be complaining about that.
The display on the clock has not budged from 11℃.
Either the machine is on the fritz or there's something wrong with my body temperature.
I look around to see if there's another thermometer,
"――――――What's that?"
My eyes are glued to the monitor installed in the room showing the hotel lobby.
<Page24>
"It's burning...?"
I couldn't believe my eyes.
It was a scene straight out of a movie.
<Page25>
The flames splash and spill outwards in waves.
A human-like figure writhes around, sputtering black smoke.
A large carnivore is greedily devouring that 'figure'.
<Page26>
"Arcueid...!"
"........."
Arcueid doesn't say a word.
Is it hostility... no, perhaps it's contempt?
She stares at the monitor with an emotion different from mine.
<Page27>
The lobby sinks into a sea of flames in less than a minute.
The fire alarms do not ring.
The thermometer remains stagnant.
My sweating doesn't stop, and my throat becomes dry with thirst just from breathing.
<Page28>
There is nothing left to think about.
It's the enemy. Those burning corpses from this afternoon―――those things have come to this hotel...!
<Page29>
"Damn it...!"
I run to the window to see what's happening outside.
<Page30>
There's no change in the cityscape.
Despite the flames rising this high, none of the people outside have noticed anything out of the ordinary.
There's nobody coming into the hotel, nor is there anyone trying to escape from it.
<Page31>
"What the hell is going on, Arcueid?!"
"........."
<Page32>
Arcueid is stubbornly keeping her mouth shut.
<Page33>
"―――――"
Time is running out.
My body temperature is slowly creeping up, to the point that it feels my skin is about to roast.
<Page34>
I don't know what's going on outside in the corridor.
I don't even know what's going on downstairs.
The only thing that comes to mind is a vague feeling that it's already too late.
<Page35>
Arcueid remains silent.
Could it be due to anxiety, or could it be a form of frustration?
She continues to stand still, clutching herself, seemingly trying to hold something back.
<Page36>
She'd said something along the lines of 'I'm not leaving this room.'
It was like she was trying to say that her power was not strong enough to go out.
In that case.
What should I be doing in this situation?
C:> I'm going to leave the room and check outside.
C:> I'll stay in the room and see what happens.
