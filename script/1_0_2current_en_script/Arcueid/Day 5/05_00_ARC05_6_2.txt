<Page1>
I can't go down like this.
The floor of the pit is completely covered in blue flames.
<Page2>
A tall vampire stands at the center.
Vlov Arkhangel.
He was right at the center of that explosion, but there's not a scratch on him.//あの爆撃のただ中にいて、傷一つ負っていない。
By human standards, he's practically an immortal monster.
And then―――
<Page3>
There is a white figure toying with the man from the front.
A beautiful huntress darting through the garden of flickering flames and debris.
<Page4>
Of course, that white figure is Arcueid.
She leaps across the river of flames and closes in on Vlov.
<Page5>
He has a crude yet deadly weapon gripped in his hand.
Although it has the appearance of a long sword, the blade is that of a machete.
Arcueid on the other hand is fighting empty-handed.
Using the force of her legs alone, she closes in on Vlov. And then―――
<Page6>
She exchanges blows with Vlov's machete using just her claws, forcing the tall figure to retreat...!
<Page7>
There's a single gash on his arm, so deep you can see straight through to the bone.
It is only there for an instant. The arm sliced open by Arcueid's claws is healed by the very blood that pours forth.
<Page8>
Arcueid had told me that so long as a vampire has blood, they are immortal and possess an abundance of life force.
It's exactly as she said.
In the blink of an eye, a wound that would have killed a normal creature had disappeared as though it were never there.
<Page9>
The massive weapon is swung without hesitation.
Arcueid keeps her distance.
After each strike, she moves out of his range and prepares for the next attack.
<Page10>
Is she being cautious of Vlov's counterattack... No, that's not it.
That face... Is she enjoying cornering him...?
<Page11>
"Is being tough to kill the only redeeming feature you have?
The quality of the Twenty-Seven Ancestors has truly fallen. Are you really going to let me kill you like this without revealing your trump card?"
<Page12>
"―――,―――,―――"
Vlov's breathing has become erratic.
His morbidly pale faced is etched with pain and anguish.
<Page13>
...Vlov is most definitely immortal.
But even that has its limits.
It may seem like he's unharmed, but there's no doubt that Arcueid's dive bombing inflicted a fatal wound, even for him.
<Page14>
Perhaps regenerating his body is all he can manage right now.//This is conjecture on Shiki's part, feels like it ought to have qualifier, but there isn't one in the source 体は再生したものの、それが精一杯。
It's easy to assume that he spent most of his energy on reviving himself, just as Arcueid did when she was killed by me.
<Page15>
In fact, Arcueid seems to have come to the same conclusion.//事実、アルクェイドもそう見ている
That's the reason why she's keeping her distance after every attack.
She is inviting Vlov to perform one final attack. A counterattack with all his might.
<Page16>
Countless clashing sounds echo through the air.
Vlov's breathing grows even more frantic.
"―――No, that's―――"
A sense of unease that I can't put into words.
Arcueid has the upper hand. It's clear that Vlov is being worn down.
And yet as a bystander, I feel a growing sense of dread in my heart.
<Page17>
The dread stems from the fact that Vlov is taking far fewer hits from Arcueid's claws than he was a little while ago.//それは、ヴローヴが先ほどからアルクェイドの爪を受けなくなりつつある状況であり、
<Page18>
His swordsmanship... or rather, machetemanship, is also much more formidable than one would expect given his appearance.//Made up word but kinda matches the joke better ヤツの剣さばき......いや、鉈さばきは...
<Page19>
On top of that, it's clear that he's already able to see right through Arcueid's speed and movements. But most importantly of all―――
He still hasn't used that 'flaming hand' of his...!
<Page20>
"GU――――――AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!"
"―――!"
<Page21>
Vlov lets out a roar.
The flames blaze in response to his bellow of rage.
The apocalyptic flames reach a height of several meters,//Not sure what a good TL is for 劫火
and the river of fire splits into dozens of streams.
<Page22>
The underground arena turns into a forest of fire.
The wall of flames blocks off Arcueid's escape.
And with the stage set―――
<Page23>
A 'hand' of unparalleled heat is unleashed toward Arcueid, melting the rubble in its path.
<Page24>
"Arcueid―――!"
In an instant.
The tide of battle is completely reversed.//Second 一瞬 elided, felt redundant 戦いは一瞬でひっくり返った
<Page25>
Arcueid said that she could withstand temperatures of up to 3000℃.
However, the 'hand' that melted the rubble with ease had a temperature well over that.
<Page26>
Three more of those 'hands' are piled on. Not even ashes will remain at this rate. There's no escape from the tormenting tongue of flame as it licks its prey clean.
The white figure burns away without a trace.
―――At least, that's what would have occurred if this had happened last night.
<Page27>
The flames are torn apart.
A white skirt flutters in the air.
Enraptured, I'm unable to tear my eyes away from her transformation.
<Page28>
I recall her saying something earlier.
'I have a countermeasure. I'll rebuild my body beforehand.'//Referenced to 05_00_ARC05_3_2B.txt:L30
<Page29>
Vlov's flames seem to mean nothing against the black and white battle costume.//Ruby is ドレスコード, doesn't feel like it makes sense to include?
Is the dress absorbing the flames? Or is she herself now impervious to them as a result of recreating her body?
<Page30>
In any case, the flames are unable to affect her now.
Arcueid's countermeasure is flawless.
As soon as she had identified her opponent as a monster of flames and escaped from that hotel, her victory was assured.
<Page31>
A 'hand' of flame is unleashed.//炎の手が繰り出される
Arcueid casually thrusts out her left hand.
In a motion similar to combing her hair, she disperses the towering wall of flames that surrounded her.
<Page32>
The wall of flames bows its head, submitting to the white dress.
Her golden hair whips about like a shower of shooting stars.// Too much? 金の髪が流星のように駆けていく。
<Page33>
Her claws fly through the air and rain down on Vlov with power unlike anything I have ever seen before.//飛翔し、振り下ろされた爪の威力は今までの比ではない。
As he helplessly retreats, her claws strike a second time, then a third.//たまらず後退するヴローヴに、第二第三の爪が繰り出される。
<Page34>
An overwhelming difference in ability.
This is no longer a battle.
As soon as his flames were nullified, Vlov became mere prey to be hunted.
Arcueid's claws are unrelenting, and continue to accurately inflict mortal wounds on Vlov's body.//アルクェイドの爪は的確に、間断なく、ヴローヴの肉体に致命傷を重ね続ける。
<Page35>
The only reason Vlov is still standing is probably because he has some blood remaining.
But even that is going to run out at some point. Unluckily for him, there are no humans around from whom to extract resources.
The only blood he has left is that which flows within his own body.
After only a few more blows even that reserve will run dry.
<Page36>
In other words, bankruptcy.
If the energy he needs in order to revive is lost, his body will rightfully revert back to being a corpse.
<Page37>
"―――Stop, it―――"
He begs for his life without any pretense.
Just like a spoiled child.
His mastery of the machete is also lost.
He swings it haphazardly, as if to dispel the fearful sight in front of him. But Arcueid is not going to let such a clumsy opening pass by.
<Page38>
"It's cold――― It's cold――― This place, is cold―――!"
Screaming, the vampire leaps.
Mustering the last of his <blood|s t r e n g t h   >, Vlov jumps backwards. No, upwards.
<Page39>
He jumps from the floor of the pit toward the surface.
Even a height of 40 meters is not enough to stop a vampire.
It's likely that he is planning to replenish his blood supply on the surface.
<Page40>
Green ivy tangles around his legs.
The ivy that sprouted from beneath the rubble grows at a terrifying speed, grabs Vlov's feet and pulls him back down.
<Page41>
"A―――AA, AAAA―――!"
A river of flame appears once again at Vlov's feet.
Engulfed by a fire that burns only life, the green ivy is reduced to ashes.
However, his shackles do not vanish.
New ivy, fertilized by the ashes, entwines itself around him.//その灰を苗床にして、新たな蔦が絡みつく。
<Page42>
No matter how many times he burns them away, he cannot break free. Like a phoenix, they return again and again.//何度焼き尽くしても束縛は<解|ほど>けない。不死鳥のようにループする。
That's right. If vampires are considered immortal, then the workings of nature are also an eternal, infinite cycle.
<Page43>
The ivy is a manifestation of that. To break free, you'd need a 'fire' able to burn the entire planet to the core.//あの蔦はその結晶。この星を燃やし尽くす"火"でなくては逃れる事はかなわない。
But for Vlov――― No, for a 'curse' of a vampire like him, Arcueid's breath alone is more than enough to extinguish it......!// ヴローヴでは―――いや、あの吸血鬼程度の"呪い"では、彼女の息吹を消す事などとてもとても......！
<Page44>
―――Arcueid runs.
From the intensity of her stance, I can tell that this is the finishing blow.
<Page45>
All of Vlov's counterattacks have been thwarted.
She has decided to end it all with this.
I'm in agreement.
There is no need to wait for my assistance. At this rate, Arcueid will crush Vlov into pieces.
<Page46>
...And yet.
And yet I can't help but be apprehensive.
Something is wrong.
His agony, his breathing, they entreat me to notice what's amiss.//ヤツのあの苦悶が、息づかいが、俺に"そうではない"と訴えてくる。
<Page47>
Vlov's complexion and anguish have become even more ghoulish.//ヴローヴの顔色、苦しみようは今や病的だ
Within that scorching heat, he exists in his own separate world.//あの灼熱の中で一人だけ世界が違う
His breath is white, as if the world he exists in is the polar opposite of ours.//まるで正反対の世界にいるような白い呼吸
<Page48>
...I know those eyes.//あの手の眼は知っている
The instinct for both fight and flight.//強迫観念と防衛本能
He is simultaneously the perpetrator and the victim.
That's why―――
――――――We are definitely making a fatal error.
<Page49>
"You idiot... What the hell am I thinking...!?"
Arcueid's victory is inevitable.
There's no way I'm going to interfere at a time like this.
<Page50>
I don't have to do anything.
There's no need for me to go out of my way and enter that hellscape.
Knowing that, I―――
C:> have no choice but to watch the battle from here.
C:> call out to Arcueid to stop.
