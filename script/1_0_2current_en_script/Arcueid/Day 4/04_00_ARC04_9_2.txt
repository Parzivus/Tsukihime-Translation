...Let's stay in the room and see what happens.
As long as Arcueid can't move, it's not safe to go outside recklessly.
<Page2>
"........."
...Time is ticking away.
Grasping the knife with one hand, I stare at the monitor displaying nothing but flames.
<Page3>
Arcueid's eyes are closed.
Her image now reminds me of how she appeared under the moonlight a little while ago - how beautiful, or rather, how powerful.
More than half a day has passed since the incident in the alleyway.
Her 'power' must have returned a little by now.
<Page4>
...
.........
...............It's hot.
It feels like I'm being smothered by a flame burning right in front of me.
<Page5>
It's becoming difficult to breathe.
I decided that I would be safe as long as I was in this room, but at this rate, I'll die before I can do anything.
<Page6>
"......"
...Maybe I should have accepted the risk and gone outside?
There's still some time left.
I should go over my options carefully again and then...
<Page7>
The lights go out.
The mysterious high-temperature anomaly also comes to an end.
At the same time,
I hear countless knocks on the door.
<Page8>
"Shiki, are you ready?"
Just those few words,
Arcueid mutters from the midst of the darkness.
"...Ready, for what...?"
There was no reason for me to ask that.
<Page9>
―――If staying in this room was a mistake,
then was it also a mistake to ask such a question?
<Page10>
I hear the door being broken down and turn to look at it.
<Page11>
"――――!"
A moment of hesitation,
as well as the fact that I stepped away from the door as a safety precaution,
has ultimately led to this being the 'result'.
<Page12>
It was two dogs that had broken down the door and entered.
Immediately after they were flung away by Arcueid's claws,
an unprecedented amount of fire poured into the room, filling it to the brim and leaving no place to hide.
<Page13>
"Ah―――――aah, ah―――――――――――――"
Unless the temperature is exceedingly high, fire won't kill a person immediately. But this flame was like a blunt weapon that could reduce a human body to ashes with a single blow.
<Page14>
...It reminds me of the mechanics of a flamethrower.
Although it looks like it's shooting flames, in reality, it is hurling fuel at its target, so more literally it is 'setting it on fire'.
<Page15>
This fire is probably similar to that.
Anything touched by that whip of flame will dissolve into ash.
<Page16>
There is no way a human body can withstand something that so easily incinerated tables and walls.
The only good thing about it was that it was so powerful that my upper body was blown away in an instant, sparing me the pain of being burned to death by the flames.
