Arcueid's room isn't exactly what I'd have expected of a vampire.
...Last time I was here, I didn't pay any attention to the room itself. Now that I do, I see that it is pretty mundane.
<Page2>
There're no bottles filled with human blood,
nor can I spot any bizarre sculptures or anything like that.
<Page3>
"...There's even tableware and a refrigerator.
What's up with this woman?"
<Page4>
I lay Arcueid down on the bed as I grumble.
Although her body was light, it wasn't easy to carry her all the way here.
<Page5>
"...Hah."
I sit down on the floor and take a deep breath.
It's almost seven o'clock in the morning.
<Page6>
"...That's right. I should close the curtains."
<Page7>
I whip my sluggish body back into shape and close the curtains.
After doing what I could, I should finally be able to relax.
But on my way to go sit down, my knees give out and I fall to the floor with a thud.
<Page8>
"...How pathetic. To think that I'm this worn out after carrying just a single girl."//Explicit girl here
<Page9>
...Ever since the accident, I've had a hard time recovering from my injuries.
Which isn't to say that I don't get enough exercise. When I lived with the Arimas, I was exercising as much as I could thanks to their dojo.
<Page10>
After all, for someone with poor physical strength, even a common cold can become a matter of life and death.
I'm proud to say that my fundamental physical strength is on par with the average person. However, there is no way for me to improve my stamina.
I'm like a track and field athlete who can do short sprints, but not a marathon.
<Page11>
"......Hah."
I'm so tired that I can't even get up.
On top of having talked with Arcueid all night, I haven't had a decent meal in over a day.
It's crazy that I've lasted this long.
<Page12>
"...Arcueid... Her wounds, will she be okay...?"
I steal a glance at the woman lying on the bed.
Her abdomen has stopped bleeding, and even if she is torn from limb to limb, she can simply come back to life. Maybe there's no reason to be worried after all.
<Page13>
"...What should I do?"
This fever is making me lightheaded.
I'm so exhausted I can barely breathe, and yet here I am worrying over her condition. I guess I must have come down with something pretty serious―――//Drop explicit 風邪 to lean into catching feelings as a subtext
<Page14>
"―――The crash is believed to have been caused by an unknown malfunction in the motorcycle's brake pedal, causing it to fall off of the sudden drop at the side of the road.
Two people were injured, but fortunately, no one was killed."
<Page15>
"...Was I sleeping?"
It seems that I fell asleep on the floor.
For some reason, the curtains are open and there is a bedsheet covering my body.
<Page16>
The time is just past noon.
There's no sign of Arcueid on the bed, and the TV has been left broadcasting a steady stream of dull news to nobody in particular.
<Page17>
"Where did she go...?"
I sit up and look around the room.
In the room next to me... I feel a person's presence coming from the kitchen.
<Page18>
"...What is she doing, moving around in her state?"
I move the sheet away and stand up.
I need to go to the kitchen immediately and check on her wounds.
<Page19>
"And for our next story.
A fire erupted today in the early morning at the Kuramibashi Dome Hotel. None of the internal fire alarms went off, and as a result the fire went unreported until staff returning to work at six o'clock discovered the irregularity inside the hotel and contacted the authorities.//why is the changed to 6AM?
As of now, they are currently working together with firefighters to combat the flames inside."
<Page20>
"―――――"
My feet stop all of a sudden.
I can't help but be glued to the news footage.
<Page21>
"The safety of the 200 guests who were staying in the hotel has yet to be confirmed. The firefighters are presently working at a rapid pace to extinguish the fire. However, thus far not a single victim has been discovered inside the hotel―――"
<Page22>
The newscaster reads out the news in an uninterested manner.
The screen changes, showing the exterior of the hotel where we had just been, along with a list of the names of the two hundred missing guests.
Neither mine nor Arcueid's name is on the list.
<Page23>
"In addition, according to the police report, the damage to parts of the walls within the hotel has lead to theories that the incident was caused not by a regular fire, but by an explosion as a result of structural defects within the hotel―――"
<Page24>
With a click, I turn off the TV.
"―――"
<Page25>
The safety of the guests has yet to be confirmed―――?
Not a single victim has been discovered―――?
How can you say that when you have so much information?
The information that all the people that stayed at the hotel were engulfed in those unfathomable flames and burned without a trace.
<Page26>
"――――"
...I hold back my nausea.
I can't think back to the tragedy or I'll end up vomiting.
Wallowing in self-pity in this situation would make me worse than a pig.
As the only one who escaped that hotel with his life intact, I cannot allow myself to feel anything but hatred.
<Page27>
Two hundred people.
Two hundred human beings were slaughtered arbitrarily, without even being allowed to retain their original form.
<Page28>
The face of that vampire looms over my thoughts.
I don't know what kind of person he is.
But I do know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is the cause of all this.
―――That's right.
The only thing I know for certain is that he's someone who cannot be allowed to live.
<Page29>
"――――――"
...I wonder if my heart is still paralyzed.
The fear continues to persist, even now.
My rage continues to swirl intensely.
And yet, my thoughts are turning cold.
<Page30>
...It's like my heart and mind have become separate.
Just thinking about that cloaked man makes me want to scream, yet the sharp sensation in my fingertips continues to grow.
I don't need such useless feelings. I don't need more reasons to be angry either.
There is only one thing I must do. And that is to simply cut those―――
