'We'll wait until your strength is restored.'
Relieved by this plan, Arcueid soon fell asleep.
<Page2>
I watched her until I was sure she was sleeping, then walked out of the apartment.//見届けて
...My destination is obvious.
It's the department store in front of the station where Vlov's stronghold is.
<Page3>
The area in front of the station is no different than usual.
Advertisements and goods are on display up and down the colorful shopping district. People come and go, occasionally glancing at the shop windows as they pass by.
At the center of the bustle stands a large, familiar department store.//その流れの中の一つに、見慣れた大きな百貨店がある。
<Page4>
It's one of the biggest department stores in the city.
Even now, a large number of people come in and out of the department store which has become the embodiment of Souya Station. Is this really where...?
<Page5>
"...This place is a prime spot in front of the station.
There's not the slightest trace of a vampire anywhere..."//吸血鬼なんて影も形もないだろ
<Page6>
But I don't think Arcueid was lying.
She's got no common sense, but her judgment and information are accurate.
It may be precisely because she's not bound by common sense that she arrived at this improbable conclusion.//有り得ない事実
<Page7>
"Come to think of it... Arihiko did say that some strange rumors were spreading about the north gate..."//北口でおかしな話があるって言ってたな
<Page8>
'There is a part-time job that anyone can do and it pays well.'
It's an urban legend with no credibility, a transparent ploy that almost certainly spells trouble.//Not sure about 誘い文句 - 信憑性のない都市伝説、子供だましの誘い文句だ。
If it's persisted this long on the internet, neither disappearing nor conspicuously spreading, it may be because it's not totally a lie.
<Page9>
There's no one who can testify to the details of this part-time job. It's also unclear whether anyone has actually experienced it.
Nevertheless, rumors about this part-time job continue to circulate.
The number of people receiving these messages is unspecified, but they are continually sent out.
<Page10>
...In other words, this means that regardless of the authenticity of the content, there's someone out there who needs outsiders.
<Page11>
As it turns out, there's nothing unusual about the department store.
From the grocers in the basement to the specialty shops on the seventh floor, it's an ordinary department store.
Except...
<Page12>
"...There isn't anything above the seventh floor. Considering the size of this department store, it should have at least ten floors..."
<Page13>
The elevator only has buttons to go up to the seventh floor, and once you reach the seventh floor landing on the stairs there's a sign saying that anything further is off-limits.//階段は七階に立ち入り禁止の立て札が置かれていた。
<Page14>
Aiming for a moment when no one is around, I slip past the no-entry rope and climb up the stairs.
The stairs lead up to the upper floors, but I'm blocked.
The path leading to the eighth floor is shuttered, as expected.//八階のフロアに通じる部分には、当然のようにシャッターが下ろされている。
Next to it, there is a locked emergency door.
<Page15>
"...If there's anything here, it's on the other side of this door..."//Reified for flow 何かあるとしたら、この向こうか
I ponder whether to go inside or to return back.
<Page16>
I know that what I'm trying to do is reckless.//自分が無謀な事をしようとしているのは理解している。
I'll be entering that monster's hideout alone.
I've experienced firsthand, time and again,//それがどれほどいかれた事かは、俺はもう、何度も味わって知っている。
how crazy such a move is.//I've inverted 53 and 54
<Page17>
"...It's okay. I should be able to do it."
I clutch the knife hidden in my pocket.
I've got these eyes if it comes down to it.
<Page18>
I thought about running to the police and explaining the situation. It's the safest thing to do.
But what would that achieve? In the first place, I'm going to kill him. How is a killer supposed to be able to persuade the police to help him? There's no way such natural adversaries could share a common purpose.
<Page19>
"...I'll just scope it out first.
If things get out of hand, I can go back to Arcueid's room..."
<Page20>
I take off my glasses and 'kill' the lock on the emergency door.
I nervously swallow, feeling the saliva go down my numbed throat.
After taking a deep breath to calm myself down, I slink up to the floor where the lights had gone out.
<Page21>
The entirety of the eighth floor is pitch black.
It's only natural considering that the lights are off, but it's still very unexpected.
It is daytime. Even if the power is off, the floor should still be bright from the sunlight coming through the windows.
<Page22>
However, each and every window is blocked from the inside with something that looks like an iron plate.
This is too much to simply be anti-theft measures.
The iron plates are attached with bolts and cannot be removed by human strength alone. Even the small window in the bathroom has a plate attached to it.//人の力
<Page23>
It's like a pathological obsession. And yet, the work is messy.
The size of the steel plate doesn't quite match the size of the window, so there's still sunlight passing through the tiny gaps.
<Page24>
Rather than being here to prevent intruders from entering... I can only see it as a move to prevent someone inside from escaping.
<Page25>
Or―――am I simply overthinking it, and this is just a sunshade?//Sunshade in italics, ruby dots <日|・><除|・><け|・>
Even so...
<Page26>
"...Isn't this place... too clean?"
Even though there's dust everywhere in the hallway, there's no foul smell nor strange bodies to be found.
<Page27>
This must just be a floor under renovation.
I don't see anything that's reminiscent of the disaster that happened at the hotel.
<Page28>
"The ninth floor is clean too... I wonder if Arcueid misunderstood something..."
<Page29>
I slightly release the tension in my nerves.
I go up to the tenth floor, not realizing that letting my guard down, however slightly, could be fatal.
And then, at that moment―――
<Page30>
"Haaa? Who the hell are you, and what are you doing, waltzing into someone else's house like that?"
<Page31>
I square up at the sudden sound of someone speaking.
At the entrance by the top of the stairs, stands a duo with flashlights.//階段を上がりきったエントランスには、懐中電灯を持った二人組が立っていた。 二人組, translated as 'duo' to be consistent with 05_00_ARC05_3_1
<Page32>
"........."
I observe them, squinting into the light.
They are both male, and around the same age as me.//年齢は俺とそう変わらない。
They only have flashlights in their hands, no long-handed tools like bats or pipes.
<Page33>
"Hey, why aren't you talking? Are you aware that you're doing something wrong? What's with this guy, isn't he lame? He's clearly scared, right? He's a totally different breed from us, yeah? Hey Toshi, do you know this guy with glasses?"
<Page34>
"Nah, no way. If I knew such an otaku, I would've died of embarrassment.
Hey, you there, come over here, okay? If you run away, you'll get hurt badly, you get it? Or should I just kill you? The law says I can kill you for trespassing!"
<Page35>
The duo laugh but don't move away from where they stand... in front of the elevator.
'Don't run away' they said, but I didn't even consider fleeing via the stairs.
<Page36>
"What's with the lack of response? Aren't you going to run away? It's normal to run away in this situation. Toshi, isn't there something fishy about this guy?"
"Your face is so nasty, the shock was too much for that four-eyes... Hey, that's it, right? You're just confused, huh? Why are you playing around in an area that's off-limits?"
"........."
In the darkness, I thought I saw a dull glint in the eyes of the duo.
<Page37>
"........."
What do I do?
Should I run away or try to talk to them?
Is this really the den of that vampire in the first place?
Can I check that with these two guys?//ruby dots <確|・><認|・><し|・><て|・>
<Page38>
"Ohh, could it be our lucky day?//ボーナスタイム
Hey Toshi, they said we can do whatever we want with those who don't have an appointment, remember!"//Assuming the do what you want came from above, not Toshi, but correct me if I'm wrong
<Page39>
"Shut up, Haru. Stay quiet for one minute.
So what's going on, otaku? Was it just on a whim?"
"........."
<Page40>
I'll obtain as much information as I can about what's going on here.//情報と、状況を整理する。
I keep a close eye on the movements of the duo.
<Page41>
"...I'm sorry. I heard that you can get a part-time job here..."
I said in a meek voice while looking closely at the man named Toshi.
<Page42>
"...A part-time job, huh? Where did you hear about it? It's something that I've only talked about with a bunch of stupid girls lately."
"I just heard a rumor. Supposedly, you can get a lot of money by spending the night at the apartment near the north gate."
